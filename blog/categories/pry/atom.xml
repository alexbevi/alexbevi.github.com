        <content type="html"><![CDATA[My Ruby workflow as of late has almost always contained [Git](http://www.git-scm.com) for version control, and [Pry](http://pryrepl.org/) for debugging.

Although it's extremely convenient during development to add a quick breakpoint using `binding.pry`, it can be a bit frustrating to clients if you accidentally deploy with these breakpoints still intact.

<!-- more -->

After hunting around for a bit, I decided to write a pre-commit [hook](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) that would check the files I was about to check in to ensure that I didn't accidentally still have breakpoints enabled.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/alexbevi/3436040.js"> </script>

This file just needs to be saved to `/path/to/source/.git/hooks/pre-commit` and made executable.

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>HOOK_URL="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/alexbevi/3436040/raw/pre-commit.sh"
</span><span class='line'>curl $HOOK_URL &gt; /path/to/source/.git/hooks/pre-commit
</span><span class='line'>chmod +x /path/to/source/.git/hooks/pre-commit</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

If you happen to leave a breakpoint intact, the next time you try to commit your changes, the commit will fail and indicate where these breakpoints are, and what files need to be updated to allow the commit to succeed.
