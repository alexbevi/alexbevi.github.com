        <content type="html"><![CDATA[I don't really have much progress to report for the last month, so I thought I'd throw out a few of the games I've been working through to see if I can generate any interest in the next article ;)

{% img left /images/goldensun/goldensun.016.png %}

First off, I've been playing through [Golden Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Sun) for the GBA.

I really like the psyenergy system and how you use it for puzzle solving. It makes this game a bit more of an ARPG along the same lines as [Lufia 2]({% post_url 2015-09-23-just-finished-lufia-2 %}).

I've made it as far as [Kraken](http://goldensun.wikia.com/wiki/Kraken), but I'm finding beating him is proving to be more difficult that I'd expected. Probably going to have to back out and grind for a while, which I don't have a lot of time for ...

{% img right /images/7th-saga/7th-saga.019.png %}

Next, I'm pretty sure I've given up on [the 7th Saga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7th_Saga). I'm still at Telaine with a party at level 17, but I'm pretty sure that to progress, there is grinding in my future.

Similar to the situation I'm having above with Golden Sun, i just need to set many hours aside to level up in order to proceed, but with the amount of time I've got these days to devote to these games, that may never happen.

<!-- more -->

Finally, I've decided to bite the bullet and dive into [Super Mario RPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_RPG). This, along with Final Fantasy Tactics is one of those games that I've heard nothing but good things about for the last 20 years, but have never bothered to investigate myself.

{% img left /images/mariorpg/mariorpg.011.png %}

I'm currently at level 10 with 3 star pieces recovered and have just rescued Princess Toadstool and had her join the party.

I'm really enjoying the story and gameplay, but since this was developed by Square, I'm not surprised that this is right up my alley :P

I'm most likely going to be able to finish this game off, and then circle back around to Golden Sun, as I really want to beat that game.

Now, assuming I can make some progress on those two games, I'd like to start getting some feedback on where to take this series next.

There are a number of games that I've finished previously that I didn't write about. Some of the more notable ones would be:

* [Mother 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_3)
* Final Fantasy VIII
* Final Fantasy IX
* Chrono Trigger

Then there's the list of games that I really want to tackle, but since they all require a sizable time investment I'm not sure which to hit up:

* Xenogears
* Breath of Fire 3
* [Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei:_Persona_3) - *I'd likely play the PSP release*
* [Danganronmpa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danganronpa:_Trigger_Happy_Havoc) - *I started this a while back but never finished it*
* [Shin Megami Tensei 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_II) - *There's a great fan translation of the Super Famicom release*
* [Final Fantasy IV: After Years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_IV:_The_After_Years)
* [Vagrant Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagrant_Story)

If you've got any insight into which I should tackle next, feel free to leave me a comment below ;)

        <link href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2016/07/27/just-finished-dragon-quest-i/"/>
        <updated>2016-07-27T22:26:01-04:00</updated>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[I actually finished this game around the end of June, but haven't really had a chance to write about it until now. I'm currently sitting out by the lake at the cottage and figured it was about time :P

{% img left /images/dq1/dq1.000.png %}

The last time I played through Dragon Quest was likely in the late 80's. I'm pretty sure I either heard about it, or got a copy of it through Nintendo Power, and like most kids in North America at the time, this would have been my first introduction to what would become known as JRPGs.

I decided to go with the SNES re-release of this title for my playthrough as I wanted some updated graphics and music. Although the SNES version was never officially localized for North America, there is an [excellent fan translation](http://www.romhacking.net/translations/337/) available.

It threw me off a bit when they refer to the legendary hero as Roto (as opposed to Erdrick), but I'm assuming this is a better translation than what we got in the 80's so that's probably what the name should have been in the first place.

{% img right /images/dq1/dq1.001.png %}

Dragon Quest was essentially the first JRPG. As a result, there are a lot of concepts introduced here that would be adapted and refined by other titles and series over the years. This means that some parts of this game feel a bit rough or unbalanced.

I originally played the NES version of this title, and have fond memories of just how brutally hard it was. This game introduced me to what I would come to know as "grinding", as you couldn't progress through the game unless your character was sufficiently leveled up in order to tackle the monsters in the areas you were exploring.

This meant walking back and forth and fighting random monsters. 

Enemy encounter rates are high. Very high. I think the SNES version actually optimized this a bit, but the rates are still high. This is useful for grinding, but gets tedious when you want to explore, or really need to get back to a town to heal.

The story is pretty simple.

You're the descendant of the legendary hero, and have been tasked with rescuing the princess and defeating the Dragon Lord.

<!-- more -->

{% img left /images/dq1/dq1.001.png %}

To defeat the Dragon Lord, you need to get three pieces of equipment of the legendary hero which are scattered across the world.

Beat the dragon. Save the princess. Beat the Dragon Lord. Done.

Gameplay is pretty straightforward. You start off in the castle, where the king explains your quest. You can talk to people in the castle, or leave and move on to the nearest town.

Here you'll get a bit more info, or can buy supplies.

I think it's kind of cool that the first time you leave the castle you can see the Dragon Lord's castle on the world map. This gives you your target right away and you know what you're working towards.

You interact with NPCs and the world via a command menu. One of the nice additions to the SNES version is that you no longer have to use a STAIRS command to go up and down stairs; just walk over them.

{% img right /images/dq1/dq1.012.png %}

As you roam around the overworld and dungeouns, you'll get into random encounters. You interact with these using a command menu as well, where you can select to either attack, use magic, use an item, or run. 

Dragon Quest is a pretty short game. Being one of the first of this genre it introduced a lot of gameplay elements that would shape the genre, but when you look at it as a standalone title, there's not all that much there.

This isn't meant to be a knock at the game. I had a great time playing through it, but that playthrough was only a few hours.

I used an emulator to do this, so most of my level grinding was done in fast-forward, so it felt even faster to get through this title.

If you're playing the "classics", I'd definitely recommend this title. Playing these early games gives you more of an appreciation for the later RPGs, as well as giving you a feel for how it all started.

Have you had a chance to play this title? How do you think it holds up nowadays, especially with the release of the mobile ports? Have any DQ memories you want to share? Let me know in the comments.

        <link href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2016/04/19/just-finished-seiken-densetsu-3/"/>
        <updated>2016-04-19T14:30:20-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2016/04/19/just-finished-seiken-densetsu-3</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[{% img left /images/sd3/sd3.026.png %}

[Seiken Densetsu 3 (聖剣伝説3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiken_Densetsu_3) is the third installment in the [Mana series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mana_\(series\)). It's the sequel to [Secret of Mana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_of_Mana), which is the entry into the series that most North American gamers would be familiar with.

Once again, I played through this game on my phone using the fantastic [Snes9x EX](http://www.explusalpha.com/home/snes9x-ex). Please support this dev as he provides a fantastic product. For some reason though, most of the screenshots I took came out stretched. This hasn't happened before, and I've been playing a couple other games that this isn't happening for either, so I'll chalk this up to bad luck :|

{% img /images/sd3/sd3.005.png %}

*NOTE* I ran these screenshots through [pngcrush](http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/) (`ls *.png | while read line; do pngcrush -ow -brute $line; done`) to get the size down a bit ;)

I'm leaving these images in here as they were part of my "journey", though hopefully they don't deter anyone from playing this game, as the game is *fantastic*.

First off, if you're a fan of [Secret of Mana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_of_Mana), the initial "feel" of the game will be familiar, as will the art style and sound.

<!-- more -->

Whereas SoM had you gradually encounter the two other playable characters at set points in the game, SD3 has you selecting your 3 main characters before you even begin.

I decided to go with Duran, Carlie and Kevin (something about a werewolf named Kevin made me chuckle :P). Duran's story starts off with the castle where he lives being invaded by a wizard who almost kills him. The wizard lets Duran live, so naturally Duran has to set off on a quest to find and defeat the wizard.

{% img /images/sd3/sd3.004.png %}

On this journey, he'll run into the other characters I selected (Kevin and Carlie), and each of their stories will mix into Duran's. This is actually a really cool element of this game as it gives it a lot of replay value. No matter what combination of characters you pick, their stories will all overlap. Also, you'll run into all the other characters you didn't pick, so every character makes an appearance throughout the game.

{% img right /images/sd3/sd3.010.png %}

You travel around the game mostly on foot initially, but eventually new methods of travel will open up. As with SoM, you can get to certain areas via Cannon Travel (though there's a couple of fetch-quests before you can actually take advantage of this). There's also a ship, a weird turtle thing, and eventually Flammie the dragon.

The combat system is reminiscent of SoM as well, though this time around it feels a lot more "button mash-ey". I found that I just spammed the B button throughout most of this game and didn't really use any strategy during combat; aside from healing periodically.

{% img left /images/sd3/sd3.014.png %}

You get experience by killing enemies, which will allow you to level up your characters. Leveling up lets you increase various stats, that should make your characters perform better in future battles.

As you make your way through the game, you'll start finding these pillars that are guarded by stronger enemies. These are the Mana stones, and apparently contain God-beasts that will be awakened if you shatter the stones.

These stones can also be used to change your character's class. This is another cool aspect of this game, as it give the leveling system a bit more flavour. You can change classes twice in this game; once at level 18, and again at level 38. Each of these classes is aligned with either "Light" or "Dark", and gives the character new skills/improvements.

{% img /images/sd3/sd3.017.png %}

The game can feel a bit "grindy" due to the need to constantly trudge back and forth between areas, and there are enemies on each screen. These battles are all avoidable, but you'll want to level up for the boss fights, and eventually the God Beasts.

While you're trekking though, you get to enjoy some really good background music. If you like Secret of Mana, you'll love Seiken Densetsu 3. You can have a listen over at [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrywwZ7oL2w&index=30&list=PL4649F0DBF0FC09E3) to get an idea what's in store for you ;)

{% img right /images/sd3/sd3.031.png %}

The artwork is also top notch. It's really a shame this game never made it to North America as this is possibly one of the best looking SNES games out there. The background design, character design and monster sprites are all very, very well done. There is a lot of variety to the various regions of the world.

Once you've shattered all the Mana stones, you unleash the God Beasts. Their position is shown on the world map, and they can be fought in any order, but it's a good idea to start from the top left of the map and work your way through them sequentially.

I learned this the hard way as I only play this game on occasion, and ended up forgetting where I was. This resulted in A LOT of backtracking to find the last couple of beasts.

I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game and would highly recommend this to anyone out there that likes JRPGs, action RPGs and 8/16-bit gaming in general. The graphics, music and gameplay are all very well done, and the story lines are interesting, even if there is occasionally some cheesy dialog :P

I finished this game over a month ago, so I'm still pretty slow cranking out these reviews ...

I'm currently working my way through [The 7th Saga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7th_Saga) for SNES since I clearly need *more* pain and frustration in my life :P When that game is annoying me, I'm also working on Sega Genesis version of [Shadowrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_\(1994_video_game\)).

That game was recommended by some of my readers on Reddit so I figured I had to give it a whirl. So far I'm actually really enjoying it, and it is VERY different the the SNES game of the same name.

Hopefully I'll have more for you in the near(er) future :)

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[I had this game finished around Christmas, but I find my motivation for writing these articles is starting to languish. I'm hoping to get that spark back with the next couple of titles i'll be tackling, even though Shadownrun was one of my favourite SNES games of all time.

{% img right /images/shadowrun/shadowrun.001.png %}

You wake up on a slab in the morgue. You don't know who you are or how you got there. That's pretty much all you've got to go on when you start this game for the first time.

The intro shows you being gunned down, then a shapeshifter casts a spell on you and takes off. After getting out of the morgue, you run into "Dog", who appears to be a shamanistic totem.

This was the first 10 minutes of this game, and I remember playing this back in '94 and being hooked at this point.

[Shadowrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_(1993_video_game\)) is a cyberpunk action-RPG for the Super Nintendo. You control Jake Armitage, a courier who has something important uploaded to his head computer. 

<!-- more -->

You move around in an isometric fashion. You can interact with certain people by talking to them, or occasionally giving them a key item from your inventory.

{% img left /images/shadowrun/shadowrun.005.png %}

When talking to NPCs, some words will appear in bold. These can then be used as keywords in future conversations. These NPC interactions are how the story is progressed, and you'll spend a fair amount of time in this menu over the course of the game.

Once you learn the *Hiring* keyword, you can also try to hire additional shadowrunners. When they join your team, they will fight along side you ... for a while. If you've increased your leadership levels, they may stay longer.

Leveling up is done by spending karma when you rest on a bed (which also acts as a save point). You can spend your karma to boost various stats, or to level up your spells once you learn magic.

Karma is gained by fighting, which is done by moving a set of cross-hairs across the screen, and when placed over an enemy, mashing the A button. You then fire, wait, fire, wait ... etc.

{% img right /images/shadowrun/shadowrun.010.png %}

The combat in this game is pretty simple. Just stand in one place and fire. Once you're in combat mode, you can move your character, so there's not really any strategy (other than healing on occasion).

The same system is used for spells and items. You select the (spell/item) from the menu, the cursor becomes a hand icon, and you hover over your target and press a button again.

Navigating the screen using the D-pad can be a bit cumbersome; especially when fighting, but you get used to it after a while.

The game seems to be made up of a series of fetch quests that are used to get you from NPC to NPC in order to uncover more keywords, to then be used with other NPCs to trigger more fetch quests. Oh, and move the story along as well ;)

{% img left /images/shadowrun/shadowrun.006.png %}

The game is split up into 3 main areas that you can navigate to by train, one area you get to by boat, and the volcano you get to by helicopter. These areas are all opened up as the story moves along and you slowly uncover who was responsible for trying to geek you at the beginning of the game.

As you fight your way through the various areas, you'll find out that you were a courier with sensitive information in your head computer. You have a datajack in your head which is not working, so you can't access your brain by computer in order to get this information.

When you go find a street doc to fix your datajack, it triggers a cortex bomb that then needs to be defused. After this is done, you get some information about what's in your head and you can start decking (hacking) into computers.

{% img right /images/shadowrun/shadowrun.019.png %}

The decking segments are actually pretty dumb, but I love them. This is really what has kept me going back to this game time and again over the years, as I just really loved the concept.

You're physically wired into this machine, and have to battle various security countermeasures that have been installed in these systems. The battles are done by guessing when there is a hidden enemy on a grid and pressing the A button. Based on an RNG value and your computer skill level, you'll either miss or destroy the enemy.

That's it. That's all there is to it. I still love it though :P

Depending on why you were hacking in, you'll either trigger an elevator or get part of a data file. The data files are plot devices that give you bits of the story, or contain phone numbers you can use from vidphones throughout the game.

{% img left /images/shadowrun/shadowrun.024.png %}

After you've finally fought your way through the various sections of the game, you finally get to face off against Drake. He's apparently the one behind you almost being whacked. You beat him up, head back to Akimi building, fight your way up a handful of floors (fighting and decking) and finally find the AI you need to destroy.

Once done, things explode, and you can close the books on this adventure. 

The game alludes to there being a potential sequel in the works, but this never materialized. There was another Shadownrun title for [Sega Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_(1994_video_game\)), but this was a completely different game. I might play through this and do a write up one day, but I've tried playing it a couple times over the years and could never get into it (if you think I should, or want to share an opinion, there is a comments section below ... :P).

{% img right /images/shadowrun/shadowrun.027.png %}

Overall I still love this game. This is where I was introduced to cyberpunk as a kid, and I even went as far as getting the Shadowrun books ([Never Deal with a Dragon](http://www.amazon.com/Never-Deal-Dragon-Shadownrun-Vol/dp/0451450787)) that this game was very loosely based on.

The music was also a fantastic complement to the dark atmosphere of the game. [3AM On A Summer Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ome6XI_KuIw&list=PL2D5FC9FCF1AEF68C&index=2) might actually be one of my favourite tracks from the 16-bit era that wasn't composed by Nobuo Uematsu ;)

If you're revisiting the SNES and looking for something you may have overlooked during the mid '90s, pick this up and give it a spin.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[{% img right /images/lufia2/lufia2.000.png %}

This review has been a long time coming; a *VERY* long time coming. I heard about [Lufia 2: Rise of the Sinistrals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufia_II:_Rise_of_the_Sinistrals) when I was still in high school, and have been meaning to play it ever since.

Back then, I was just starting to get into JRPGs (though I probably just thought they were RPGs at the time) and was completely infatuated with anything that Square or Enix could crank out (except for [Earthbound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthBound), which is still one of my all-time faves).

In the decade(s) since my teens, I've picked up Lufia 2 a good dozen times, but have never really given it a fair shake. This time around though, since I'm doing this "Just Finished" series, I thought I'd finally sit down and do a full playthrough.

For anyone that has not played this game: PLAY IT! Lufia 2 is now in the top 10 of my favourite 16-bit JRPGs of all time. Hopefully after reading my synopsis here, anyone that was on the fence will also take the plunge (you'll thank me later!).

## Overview

Lufia 2 (aka. Estpolis Denki II, aka. エストポリス伝記II) is a hybrid of traditional JRPG and [Action RPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_role-playing_game). You control one to four characters at a time throughout the adventure, with enemy encounters being handled via fade-away to a turn-based combat system.

It turns out you (Maxim) are destined to fight the Sinistrals, so you embark on a journey to save the world. Cliché? Yup :P

Don't get me wrong, I love a good "destined to save the world" story, but after playing a handful of JRPGs in succession, I was getting a bit numb to the same story over and over again.

I decided to give this a fair chance though, and went along with it. I had never played the original [Lufia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufia) for more than 5-10 minutes, but I do remember the intro segment where you have the four heroes already in the Fortress of Doom getting ready to fight the Sinistrals.

I'm going to skip around a bit here because I just want to cover one thing, which is the end of the game ... first. The final battle with Daos for Maxim, Artea, Guy and Selan is the EXACT scene from the first game. This made me REALLY want to go back and play the first game, as I now had a connection with the characters.

Also, I thought I was a really cool transition as it tied the two games together seamlessly.

### Combat

{% img left /images/lufia2/lufia2.032.png %}

Enemy encounters on the overworld are random. As you're walking around, suddenly the screen will zoom in and boom, it's go time! For anyone familiar with JRPGs, this is pretty common.

Unlike traditional RPGs, Lufia 2 doesn't have "random" encounters in dungeons. All enemies are visible as you explore the dungeons, and though most will chase you, a lot of these battles can be avoided if you so choose.

{% img right /images/lufia2/lufia2.005.png %}

Once a battle is initiated, as opposed to a text-based menu of `Fight | Magic | Item | Run` as you might see in some games, you're presented with an icon cross (reminiscent of [Breath of Fire]({% post_url 2015-06-10-just-finished-breath-of-fire %})).

Aside from the standard Attack, Item and Magic options, there is also and Abilities option for each party member. This additional entry gives each character access to various offensive or defensive abilities that are linked to their weapons and armour. This adds another dimension to battles as you have to keep track of what skills are linked to your equipment (don't just hit 'optimize' each time) as weaker items may provide added benefits against certain enemies.

### Puzzles

{% img left /images/lufia2/lufia2.004.png %}

What I really enjoyed about this game from the moment I entered the first dungeon was the puzzles. Littered throughout each dungeon are puzzles that you need to solve in order to open a door and proceed.

Generally, these puzzles aren't all that complex, but they break up the dungeons a bit so it doesn't feel monotonous as you basically do the same things over and over in order to progress the story.

As you move further through the game, you also collect various key items, that can be used in order to help solve the various puzzles (bombs, arrows, hook shot, etc.)

{% img right /images/lufia2/lufia2.021.png %}

These add another dimension to the puzzles that keeps them interesting. I honestly didn't find most puzzles to be very challenging, but I will admit to having to use a walkthrough for at least 2 of them ... (thankfully there are excellent [guides on rpgclassics](http://shrines.rpgclassics.com/snes/lufia2/puzzles.shtml) for just these instances where you need a tiny bit of help)

### Party

Your party is made up of Maxim, and at various points Tia, Guy, Selan, Dekar and Arty.

{%img left /images/lufia2/lufia2.019.png %}

Tia is from your home village and follows you on the initial leg of the quest. You think she's going to end up being Maxim's love interest, but that changes once Selan enters the story ;)

Maxim and Selan fall in love, get married, and have a baby. This all happens around the mid-point of the game, acting as a bit of an intermission. Once they have the kid, they decide to go back out and fight so that the world is safe for their baby (and everyone else ... I guess).

{% img right /images/lufia2/lufia2.028.png %}

Guy joins as he's a good fighter and wants to help defeat the Sinistrals. Dekar's reasons are basically the same.

### Capsule Monsters

Your party can also include capsule monsters. These are optional encounters throughout the game that if you seek out result in an additional character being able to join you in battle.

{%img left /images/lufia2/lufia2.018.png %}

Each monster has an elemental affiliation, and can level up with you as you fight enemies. If the capsule monster dies in battle though, they respawn for the next fight, so there's no need to worry about their health (you can't heal them). They do tend to run from a lot of battles automatically though, which can be annoying.

Capsule monsters can also be made stronger by leveling them up through feeding them weapons, armour and items.

This got a bit annoying as I had to hear a lot of "Yuk"s from the monsters while trying to find the right items to feed them.

### Music

I just quickly wanted to touch on the music in this game. For a JRPG not composed by [Nobuo](http://vgmdb.net/artist/77), the soundtrack is pretty solid.

If you've got a minute, check out a couple of songs below to get a taste of what's in store for you ;)

* [Final Battle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Fzm2O4Zt-k&index=44&list=PL6BB4862ADAA12E48)
* [Peace of Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E-AD-OUxKg&list=PL6BB4862ADAA12E48&index=10)
* [The Lost World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fk3omXPfuVM&list=PL6BB4862ADAA12E48&index=41)
* [Battle Theme 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLIrE5ivseQ&list=PL6BB4862ADAA12E48&index=46)

In case you're wondering, composition credit goes to [Yasunori Shiono](http://vgmdb.net/artist/313).

### Ancient Cave

This is a completely optional dungeon, but if you're going to play Lufia 2, you HAVE to try and clear it ;)

The ancient cave is 99 randomly generated floors, and you start the cave at level 1 (no matter where you actually are in the game). As you level up and descend further into the cave, you find various treasures and spells that you can only use within the cave.

If you warp out, you lose all experience and items you've found; aside from items in blue chests (which are few).

{% img right /images/lufia2/lufia2.038.png %}

Once you make it to the last level of the cave, you fight the Master Jelly. This is a brutal fight, as you only have 3 turns in order to beat him, and if you don't, he just runs and that's the end of it (you have to warp out).

Note that I basically cheated to beat him. If you can kill your entire party before he runs, you'll actually win the fight.

I did this, but I didn't find all the Iris Treasures in the cave so it didn't really matter.

## Summary

As great as you probably think I think this game is by now, it is not without its faults.

First off, this game is *extremely* linear. The plot progresses as follows:

* Go to <tower name> tower to find <plot point>
* Climb tower and fight enemy
* Go back to town to learn where next town is
* Go to shrine to advance to next town

Sure you get a boat at a certain point and it "opens" up the map, but you still basically go from town to town and tower to tower without much variety.

Also, it may be that I'm just a bit more experienced in the genre and know how to level grind, but I found this game to be very, very easy. By the final dungeon, every battle was essentially the same (the final boss included): fight, fight, valor, fight.

All in all though, I really enjoyed this game. Although the story seemed like it was going to be pretty basic at the outset turned out the be really compelling.

There was actually quite a bit of character development. I think this is why at the end when you realize you're basically setting up the intro of Lufia I, you really want to go back and play that game to see if the story continues to be as strong.

I'll probably give this game another run through in a few years, as it really was enjoyable. I tend to do this with RPGs i enjoy as I forget specifics of the story over the years and enjoy rediscovering them. Final Fantasy IV and VI have had this treatment now probably a good 4-5 times each ;)
