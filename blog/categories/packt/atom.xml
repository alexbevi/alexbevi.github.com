        <content type="html"><![CDATA[I'd love to say Christmas came early this year, but it looks like sales of [Redmine Plugin Extension and Development](http://www.packtpub.com/redmine-plugin-extension-and-development/book) didn't quite hit the numbers needed to actually result in a royalty cheque. Ah well, there's always Q1 of 2015 :D

I've added the latest numbers to those from [my previous post](/blog/2014/09/22/second-royalty-statement/) in order to show the running total of units sold this year.

The main reason I&#8217;ve been sharing these numbers (without sharing that actual &#8220;numbers&#8221;) is to show prospective authors what types of returns they can potentially expect.

The book I wrote falls into the &#8220;minibook&#8221; category, so the returns are lower than a full-on &#8220;book&#8221; (I think < 100 pages is a minibook), but at this rate, 2015 might result in a non-negative royalty statement that I can share :)

Happy Holidays Everyone!!!

In the table below, I've added the latest numbers to those from [my previous post](/blog/2014/07/15/8748os-first-royalty-statement/) in order to show the running total of units sold this year.

Once again, I&#8217;ve decided to remove the actual sales numbers from the statement, but I left in *TOTAL ROYALTIES TO BE PAID IN PERIOD* section. I did this to show the progress from time of publication to now in terms of how much of the advance has been consumed by **ACTUAL** sales.

At this rate, it&#8217;s possible I&#8217;ll see some additional money out of this title by the time 2014 is through .. which would be very exciting.

I&#8217;m sure there are others out there who have been approached by technical publications and asked to write about some topic or other. I&#8217;m sure the numbers I&#8217;m posting here will convince you it&#8217;s not worth quitting your job and writing full time, but it looks like it *could* become profitable over time.

If you&#8217;ve had anything published and are seeing a decent return on your &#8220;investment&#8221;, please share in the comments ;)]]></content>
