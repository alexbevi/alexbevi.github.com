    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Although I haven't really had much to write about lately, I just got another royalty update from Packt Publishing about [Redmine Plugin Extension and Development](http://www.packtpub.com/redmine-plugin-extension-and-development/book) so I wanted to share the latest sales figures ... sort of :P

In the table below, I've added the latest numbers to those from [my previous post](/blog/2014/07/15/8748os-first-royalty-statement/) in order to show the running total of units sold this year.

| |Ebook Mini|Subscription Packtlib Mini|Print Book Mini|Subscription (3rd Party Mini)|

|Q1/2014|18|3|18|0|
|Q2/2014|73|1|33|2|

Once again, I&#8217;ve decided to remove the actual sales numbers from the statement, but I left in *TOTAL ROYALTIES TO BE PAID IN PERIOD* section. I did this to show the progress from time of publication to now in terms of how much of the advance has been consumed by **ACTUAL** sales.

At this rate, it&#8217;s possible I&#8217;ll see some additional money out of this title by the time 2014 is through .. which would be very exciting.

I&#8217;m sure there are others out there who have been approached by technical publications and asked to write about some topic or other. I&#8217;m sure the numbers I&#8217;m posting here will convince you it&#8217;s not worth quitting your job and writing full time, but it looks like it *could* become profitable over time.

If you&#8217;ve had anything published and are seeing a decent return on your &#8220;investment&#8221;, please share in the comments ;)]]></content>
