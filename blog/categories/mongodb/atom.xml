        <content type="html"><![CDATA[I recently found myself troubleshooting another [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) startup issue due to potential corruption within a [WiredTiger](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/wiredtiger/) file. As I have previously covered this topic (see ["Recovering a WiredTiger collection from a corrupt MongoDB installation"](/blog/2016/02/10/recovering-a-wiredtiger-collection-from-a-corrupt-mongodb-installation/)), I wanted to share the diagnostic and troubleshooting journey in case it helps anyone who experiences this issue in the future.

To ensure I could troubleshoot this issue in isolation, I first collected a backup of the necessary files from the affected installation as follows:

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>tar -czvf metadata.tar.gz --exclude<span class="o">=</span>WiredTigerStat* WiredTiger* _mdb_catalog.wt sizeStorer.wt
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

Once I had this backup I extracted it to a new location, then using [m](https://github.com/aheckmann/m) to select the versions of MongoDB to use tried to startup a standalone instance to see if I could reproduce the issue:

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>mkdir -p /tmp/repro
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">cd</span> /tmp/repro
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># move archive from earlier to the new directory first</span>

</span><span class='line'>m 3.4.18
</span><span class='line'>mongod --dbpath .
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

Once the `mongod` started, we were able to see the failure and the process aborts (clipped log sample below).

The `mongod` is failing to startup successfully due to an invariant failure during `KVCatalog::init`. We are able to determine this as the `mongod` log above tells us:

1. The MongoDB version in used (3.4.18)
2. The path to the source file where the failure occurred (file: `src/mongo/db/storage/kv/kv_catalog.cpp`, line: 305)

As MongoDB is open source, we can view the source for this release by going to https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/r3.4.18/src/mongo/db/storage/kv/kv_catalog.cpp#L305, which will show us the following:

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

The comment preceding the invariant<sup id="f1">[1](#fn1)</sup> indicates that there's only one feature document to be present in the catalog, but what's the catalog?

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>ls -l *catalog*
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r-- <span class="m">1</span> alex <span class="m">249856</span> Jan <span class="m">23</span> 03:58 _mdb_catalog.wt
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

As there's only one file that contains the word "catalog" this is good a place as any to start. The `_mdb_catalog` is a WiredTiger file, so to interact with it directly (outside of MongoDB) we will need to use the [WiredTiger command line utility](http://source.wiredtiger.com/mongodb-3.4/command_line.html), also know as `wt`.

The documentation link for `mongodb-3.4` points us to WiredTiger 2.9.2, so following the [build and installation instructions](http://source.wiredtiger.com/mongodb-3.4/build-posix.html) we compile a `wt` binary with support for the snappy compressor. This is due to MongoDB's WiredTiger storage engine using snappy as the default block compressor (see ["Compression"](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/wiredtiger/#compression)).

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">cd</span> /tmp/repro

</span><span class='line'>./configure --enable-snappy <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> make
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

Once we've successfully build the `wt` utility with snappy compression we can dump our catalog to see if we can find a duplicate entry for the feature document.

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">cd</span> /tmp/repro
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># to shorten the amount of typing required, wrap the wt utility invocation in</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># write the catalog dump out to a file</span>
</span><span class='line'>WT dump _mdb_catalog &gt; dump.txt
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

NOTE: If you receive the following error, just re-run the command.

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>wt: WT_RUN_RECOVERY: recovery must be run to <span class="k">continue</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

This error is due to the presence of content in the `journal/` that was created when we last ran the `mongod`.

With the catalog dumped we can now search it for the feature document:

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

INTERESTING! I'm not really sure how the catalog was able to get into a state where two feature documents exist, but since we have a dump of the catalog let's try to remove one of those entries and then load the dump back into the catalog.

As the results appear to be identical, we'll just drop the first one and then try to load it back into the catalog.

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c"># remove lines 935-936 and overwrite the file</span>
</span><span class='line'>sed -i -e <span class="s1">&#39;935,936d&#39;</span> dump.txt
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># drop the contents of the _mdb_catalog table</span>
</span><span class='line'>WT truncate _mdb_catalog
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># reload the table from the dump file</span>
</span><span class='line'>WT load -f dump.txt
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

If the table loaded successfully the output of the command should be something like `table:_mdb_catalog: 822`.

With a reloaded catalog, let's try spinning up the `mongod` again:

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

SUCCESS! The `mongod` is still crashing as the backing files for the database don't exist, but we should now be able to take our recovered files back to our node that was previously failing.

From our recovered directory compress the following files:

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>tar -czvf recovered.tar.gz --exclude<span class="o">=</span>WiredTigerStat* WiredTiger* _mdb_catalog.wt sizeStorer.wt
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

Note that if the `mongod` fails to start with the recovered files you may have to clear out the `journal/` directory.

Hopefully this helps someone someday ;)

Given the 3 documents we've setup above, if I wanted to filter a pipeline to only [`$match`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/match)
documents that are newer than 1 week old, I would have to resort to using Javascript:

Now if your pipeline is running in a non-Javascript environment, the `new Date()` call within the pipeline
would likely throw an exception.

If you're working with MongoDB 4.2 or newer though, a new [`$$NOW` aggregation variable](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/aggregation-variables/#variable.NOW
) is available that can be combined with existing pipeline operators to [`$subtract`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/subtract/index.html
) the number of milliseconds in the number of days to filter from the current date:

I hope you find this as useful as I did. With each major release of MongoDB new features and functionality
are being introduced that reduce the "hacks" or "workarounds" we've had to do in the past.

        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2018/10/01/technical-services-engineering-at-mongodb</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The goal of this post is to provide a first hand account of what it means to be a *Technical Services Engineer* at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/careers/jobs/791258), as well as what the journey getting to this point has looked like for me.

### WHO AM I?

I have been working in Application Development and Software Engineering for nearly two decades. I started off writing desktop applications in QuickBASIC and Turbo Pascal, then eventually in VB6, VB.NET, C++ and C#. When it was time to shift focus to web development I started off with HTML/JS/CSS (as we all do :P), then in Flash/AS3, Flex, Python, Ruby/Rails and Node.js.

I have been writing software since I was a kid, starting with some automation tools for my mom's business. I then moved on to building tools to help me cheat at various games I was playing at the time, and eventually got more into emulator programming and reverse engineering. I guess you could say I've always loved solving problems programmatically, and especially enjoyed identifying opportunities for automation and custom tooling.

This led me down an informal DevOps track, as I was finding there was a need for optimization in the infrastructure layers that my applications were deployed to. This led me deeper into Linux internals, system administration and network operations.

While I was gaining these new skill-sets my primary focus was always on application development and delivery. Before coming to MongoDB I was working as a Development Lead / System Architect, but I found that my focus was always being drawn back to solving performance challenges at the infrastructure level.

<!-- MORE -->

### WHY MONGODB?

I started working with MongoDB on a number of "hobby" projects around 2012. At the time I really only had experience with RDBMS', but due to the unstructured nature of the data I was working with decided to give this new technology a whirl.

I fell in love with the database almost immediately, and have since carried it forward to multiple new employers, as well as contract opportunities and consulting engagements.

The low barrier to entry from a development bootstrapping perspective made it the ideal backend for proof-of-concept development through to production deployment.

As a result of this increased activity with MongoDB, I found my self doing a lot more investigation into [performance issues](/blog/2018/05/28/troubleshooting-a-mongodb-performance-issue/) and [internals](/blog/2016/02/10/recovering-a-wiredtiger-collection-from-a-corrupt-mongodb-installation/) (links are to blog posts of challenges I encountered and resolved).

### WHY TECHNICAL SERVICES?

This was initially very challenging for me, as I had pre-conceived notions as to what "technical services" actually implied. The first thoughts that popped in my head were "technical support", "client support", "call center style support", etc.

While researching this position I came across a blog post from about six years ago by a MongoDB employee who blogged about his experience as a Support Engineer (in this [two](http://blog.markofu.com/2012/07/being-support-engineer-10gen-part-1.html) [part](http://blog.markofu.com/2012/10/being-support-engineer-10gen-part-2.html) series).

I found his reasons for joining MongoDB (10gen at the time), description of what kinds of challenges the job poses on a daily basis and how there is a constant push for self improvement and continuing education to align with what I was looking for in a new opportunity.

### WHAT'S A TECHNICAL SERVICES ENGINEER ON PAPER

To answer this question, let's start off by analyzing the [job posting](https://www.mongodb.com/careers/jobs/791258) that kicked off this journey for me in the first place.

<img src="/images/why_tse/why_tse_001.png">

So they're looking for people that are able to solve problems and communicate clearly. This could be a call center gig after all ... oh wait, *experts in MongoDB related database servers, drivers, tools, services* ... hrm, maybe there's a bit more to this.

<img src="/images/why_tse/why_tse_002.png">

*Architecture, performance, recovery, security*, those are a lot more complex than what you would face in a traditional support role. What really sold me though was the *contribute to internal projects* statement, as this aligned perfectly with my desire for process improvement through custom tooling.

<img src="/images/why_tse/why_tse_003.png">

By the time I got to this point in the job posting I was already sold. MongoDB is either trying to staff their first tier support with ridiculously over-qualified employees, or Technical Services really isn't what I would have thought.

I proceeded to fill out the application, attach my resume and cover letter and crossed my fingers.

### WHAT'S A TECHNICAL SERVICES ENGINEER IN PRACTICE

After working with other TSEs for the past two months and having had an opportunity to handle some of my own cases I think I can shed a bit of light on what this role really entails.

#### HOW IS IT A SUPPORT ROLE?

A Technical Services Engineer interacts with MongoDB's clients via a support queue. This allows incoming "cases" to be prioritized and categorized to allow engineers to quickly identify what form of subject matter expertise may be required (ex: `Indexing`, `Replication`, `Sharding`, `Performance`, `Networking`, etc).

As a TSE you're responsible for claiming cases from a queue and providing feedback in a timely fashion that is clear, concise and technically accurate.

#### HOW IS IT AN ENGINEERING ROLE?

Here's the juicy part of this job. Although replying to client requests is the "deliverable" for a TSE, how you go about reproducing their issues requires a very deep understanding of MongoDB internals, software engineering, network engineering, infrastructure architecture and technical troubleshooting.

Depending on the type of issue, a reproduction is likely in store. These involve recreating the environment (locally or in the cloud) to either benchmark or replicate the identified client challenge. There is a vast library of tools available to TSEs for these types of tasks, but on some occasions the right tool for the job may not exist.

In these cases, you have an opportunity to write your own scripts or tools to parse logs, measure performance, record telemetry or verify a hypothesis. Although MongoDB doesn't require TSEs to have any programming experience, for those like me that come from product engineering it's refreshing to know there's still an opportunity to scratch the development itch.

With each case you learn more about the inner working of the database, the tools, the drivers and OS level performance.

### CONCLUSION?

I'm leaving the closing section here as a question, as the TSE role continues to be redefined and refined as new MongoDB products come on board and new challenges present themselves.

What will likely remain constant though is the need for new engineers to have the following characteristics:

* a passion for continuing technical education
* a willingness to step outside their comfort zone
* an interest in software engineering
* an interest in network operations

I encourage you to check out MongoDB's [available jobs](https://grnh.se/dcd90aac1) if what I've described here interests you (I swear HR is not putting me up to this ...) as we could use more engineers like you in our ranks :)

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[As of August 13th, I am no longer a System Architect at DAC Group. I have a public post on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6432589236368601088/) that got some good traction, but to summarize it was time to move on.

I've been a software engineer in some capacity or another for nearly 20 years now. The position I've taken is as a *Technical Services Engineer*, which is more of a support role than an active development role.

The decision to make this move wasn't make lightly. I've been working hands on with code or overseeing a team of developers on a day to day basis for most of my professional career. As such, I was also involved with software engineering, and this was no different in my role as a *System Architect*.

In that role, I was still committing code on a nearly daily basis. If not, I was performing code review, or working on a design for a new system or solution. I would consider this all to still be "hands on", though I had found myself mired in DevOps work a lot more than I would have liked (there were not sufficient Linux Sysadmins available to assist with the type of server operations oversight that was required).

The role at MongoDB isn't a traditional "Tech Support" type of role, as it requires a strong knowledge of networking, databases, system design, programming and client services. I've been a fan of the MongoDB server for over 8 years now, and have brought it along with me to several new consulting opportunities as well as the full time jobs I've help. I believe very strongly in the quality of this product, as well as the peripheral products that they've developed.

I think the time has come for a new adventure. This is the first step towards a new career journey with a new company, as opposed to an incremental move upwards within the same professional space.]]></content>

        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2018/05/28/troubleshooting-a-mongodb-performance-issue</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[**UPDATE (2018-06-28):** *I actually sent a link to this article to the author of the previous blog post and in her reply she indicates that the improvements to cache management and checkpoint areas were more likely to have improved my situation. Just wanted to call out how approachable the MongoDB team is even with these one-off type issues :). Thanks Sue!*

**UPDATE (2018-06-21):** *As we were running MongoDB 3.0.15 while all these issues were going on it's entirely possible that the [optimizations made to the write-ahead log of WiredTiger](https://engineering.mongodb.com/post/breaking-the-wiredtiger-logjam-the-write-ahead-log-1-2) may have also contributed to this improvement in performance :)*

The following is an edited excerpt from an email I sent out internally about an intermittent performance issue we've been experiencing for several years now. The daily processing challenges we've been experiencing revolved around running server-side javascript in order to produce daily reports. As our data ingestion rates rose and our data processing needs climbed, our server performance continued to degrade. This would occur regardless of the size of the VMs we would spin up.

### Postmortem

Our MongoDB cluster is configured with three (3) servers: 1x primary (write-enabled) and 2x secondaries (read-only). These are running on Azure DS14v2 VMs with 8TB of storage (8x 1TB striped via LVM as these were the largest premium SSD-based data disks available at the time).

Aside from the servers being scaled up periodically, this configuration has been constant since the inception of the product.

The only major upgrade came in the form of a migration from 2.6 to 3.0 in 2015. At the time this was a major shift as it required rewriting a number of the underlying system scripts as well as introducing LRS-based storage to try and squeeze some additional performance out of the disks. Why optimize for IOPS? Because the reporting platform was designed to copy a lot of data back and forth in order to generate reports segmented by dimension ("Group", "Company", "Country", "State", "City").

<img class="center" src="/images/20180528-mongo-001.png">

This chart (48 hours sampled from 1 week ago) shows *Cache Usage* spiking and *Replication Lag* spiking. The cache spikes occur as new writes trigger index activity, which invalidates (dirties) cached memory and causes cache eviction.

<!-- more -->

This slows down the speed at which the secondaries can request data from the primary, which spikes the lag. When the secondaries request more data, it would lock up the primary, which in turn affected the primary server’s ability to ingest new content and write it to disk. The read/write buffers back up and new write requests are throttled.

**Note** &mdash; As of MongoDB 4.0, [non-blocking secondary reads](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-40-release-candidate-0-has-landed) have been added to address these types of latency issues.

This type of cascading failure was almost exclusively seen when a large batch process was being run in the morning directly on the primary mongod instance in the mornings..

<img class="center" src="/images/20180528-mongo-002.png">

This chart (48 hours sampled from 2 weeks ago) shows similar behaviour. The vertical lines show points at which we were forced to restart instances or cycle the primary server in order to recover resources.

You’ll notice that cache usage hits a certain point on the primary (left) server after which we have to kill the instance. The replication lag on the secondaries is also inconsistent, which would lead us to believe that the consumption rates from the primary are being affected by either network performance or disk performance.

In the absence of dedicated DevOps, DBAs or Infrastructure Engineers, the development teams have spent a significant amount of time learning to tune and troubleshoot this installation. Due to lack of specialization though occasionally issues may be misdiagnosed.

We completed a significant upgrade on Tuesday that brings our cluster up to mongodb-server 3.4.15 (from 3.0.15). The 3.0 series was first introduced in March 2015, with an end of life of February 2018. As no further security updates are being released, we’ve been coordinating tests with the product development teams for the past 12 months in order to prepare for a major upgrade.

This involved the deprecation of client-side javascript calls, as well as rewriting several map/reduce operations as aggregation pipelines to ensure when the transition happened there was no sudden outage.

Now that we’ve been running 3.4 in production for a few days I checked the same 48 hour sample and found something interesting …

<img class="center" src="/images/20180528-mongo-003.png">

The cache usage has remained steady since we turned the instances on. The replication lag also hasn’t gone much higher than a minute in the past few days (this could creep up to over an hour in the past!).

These samples include report generation for all products as well, so they represent the same load. We’ll have to continue to monitor this, but the initial results seem to show that a lot of the pain we’ve been suffering through may have stemmed from outdated software.

The way the review report is generated is still extremely inefficient, but if we continue seeing results like this for the foreseeable future then the urgency of redesigning that product drops and can be properly managed.

Here are some lessons we learned as a result of this investigation:

**Measure Everything** &mdash; Without proper telemetry in place, not only is it difficult to identify negative trends, but it’s almost impossible to showcase the success of any change or action.

**Understand Your Tech**  &mdash; Whether you’re using hosted, provisioned, on-premise, containerized, PAAS or some other solution as part of the application architecture, make sure you really understand how to use it, and how to support it. When MongoDB was introduced to the project it was done so to fill a specific need. Once that need was filled, resourcing discussions surrounding maintainability and support should likely have been prioritized.

**Document Everything**  &mdash; As discoveries are made, write them down and share them. Knowledge sharing is even more important when you’re dealing with issues that go beyond the standard requirements of "application development".

**Ask For Help** &mdash; When it becomes necessary to step outside your comfort zone to solve a problem, a fresh perspective can be welcome.

Hopefully this journey benefits someone else in a similar situation.]]></content>
