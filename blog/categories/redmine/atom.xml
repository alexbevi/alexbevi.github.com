        <content type="html"><![CDATA[I haven't been very actively involved with this plugin or the Redmine community as a whole lately, but it would seem there is a very active user-base still logging bugs and enhancing this project.

You can grab a copy of the release [on GitHub](https://github.com/alexbevi/redmine_knowledgebase/releases/tag/v3.2.0).

I'm pushing out version 3.2.0 of the plugin thanks to the efforts of some very dedicated community members, who I'd like to highlight below:

Thanks to Frederico Camara:

* updating acts_as_rated to work with Redmine 3.2.x

Thanks to Eduard Kuleshov:

* getting this plugin supported in Redmine 3.0.x

Thanks to Axel Kämpfe:

* getting this plugin supported in Redmine 3.1.x and 3.2.x

HUGE thanks to Rob Spearman for basically taking over the project and pushing it forward:

## New Configuaration options

* Show articles without tabs
* Show attachments before article content
* Show thumbnails for articles in lists
* Show breadcrumbs for articles in lists

## New permissions

* Article history will only show up if have view permission
* optional permission for users to manage just their own articles. (#306)

## Layout

* Sort Tags on the index page
* Added authored view so users can find articles by author easily

<!-- more -->

## Bug Fixes

* article view counts not updating (#304)
* top rated list not valid (#305)
* ActiveRecord::StaleObjectError (Attempted to destroy a stale object: KbArticle) (#300)
* Error when generating a PDF of an article with pictures (#308)
* 500 Internal Server Error - if DELETE category but it's have subcategory (#293)

Note that this is a preliminary release as there is one bug in here that I haven't squashed.

When trying to search, you're prompted with a failure similar to:

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

I'm pretty sure this has to do with how we're setting up `acts_as_searchable` in the `kb_article` model. Any suggestions welcome ;)

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[For the first five quarters that this book was out in the wild, I was posting publication numbers any time I got a royalty statement from Packt Publishing for [Redmine Plugin Extension and Development](http://www.packtpub.com/redmine-plugin-extension-and-development/book).

I haven't been very active in the [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org/) community in the past year or so as I've been a bit busy with work, contracts and life, but after seeing the last batch of sales figures, it seems people are still interested in this topic.

As was made clear with the above info, there is steady demand for this book, so there must be quite a few plugin authors out there looking to get started with the Redmine platform.

I'm going to try to get my knowledgebase and dropbox plugins updated in the next couple of months, but if there is anything Redmine-related people might be interested, please leave your comments below ;)]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[I've been meaning to write this post for a long time, as I officially got the royalty statement at the end of June, but I've been a bit busy with life, contracts and the occasional 16-bit era JRPG ...

As of this quarter, [Redmine Plugin Extension and Development](http://www.packtpub.com/redmine-plugin-extension-and-development/book) is officially earning me money!

<img class="left" src="/images/royalties-004.png">

Technically, the last statement was [in the black](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in_the_black), however since the terms laid out by Packt Publishing only pays out royalties greater than £75, those earnings were rolled into this quarter.

I've updated the table below with the numbers from the current quarter, but I'd really like to thank everyone who's bought a copy of this book for supporting the [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org/) project, and the vibrant plugin development community as well.

        <link href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2015/05/14/fourth-royalty-statement/"/>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[It's been over a year since this book was published, and I didn't think it would see the type of success it has.

<img class="left" src="/images/20150329-001.png">

Based on this last statement, I'm officially eligible to start collecting royalties off this book.

This will have to wait until next quarter as Packt only pays out if the total proceeds exceed £75; which the USD$78 I earned last quarter doesn't ;)

[Redmine](http://redmine.org) is a very popular open source project management platform, but in order to extend it users need to be familiar with not only the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) language, but the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) framework as well.

This can be quite the barrier to entry for new developers, as they need to have a fair amount of knowledge coming in.

Based on the sales figures I have access to, as well as feedback and inquiries I've received over the last year, it's safe to say that the Redmine community is thriving :)

I've updated the sales chart with my last royalty statement:

If you're one of the people that bought the book, please leave a comment and let me know what you thought.

I'm in the process of updating the [knowledgebase plugin](https://github.com/alexbevi/redmine_knowledgebase) that served as the focal point of the book to be compatible with Redmine 3.0 and beyond. If you have any ideas for new features, or feel I should get cracking on the bug fixes, log an issue :)]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[I'd love to say Christmas came early this year, but it looks like sales of [Redmine Plugin Extension and Development](http://www.packtpub.com/redmine-plugin-extension-and-development/book) didn't quite hit the numbers needed to actually result in a royalty cheque. Ah well, there's always Q1 of 2015 :D

I've added the latest numbers to those from [my previous post](/blog/2014/09/22/second-royalty-statement/) in order to show the running total of units sold this year.

The main reason I've been sharing these numbers (without sharing that actual "numbers") is to show prospective authors what types of returns they can potentially expect.

The book I wrote falls into the "minibook" category, so the returns are lower than a full-on "book" (I think < 100 pages is a minibook), but at this rate, 2015 might result in a non-negative royalty statement that I can share :)

Happy Holidays Everyone!!!
