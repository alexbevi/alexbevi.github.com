    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m currently doing a lot of scripting at work. Although the primary environment is Windows, I have to manage some Linux processes as well.</p>

<p>One example is a series of PowerShell scripts I&rsquo;ve written which abstract away various ETL tasks tha we need in order to get legacy data extracted, updated and inserted into other databases.</p>

<p>One of the longer running processes I have is a Ruby Rake task that processes an uploaded CSV file. This can potentially take a long time, and although I could modify the script to feed progress data back, I&rsquo;d like to demonstrate how to followup from another terminal session.</p>

<p>Any Rake task I write that can potentially take a while, I tend to jazz up a bit with progress details. For this current example, I am using the <a href="https://github.com/paul/progress_bar">progress_bar</a> gem, which writes an ASCII progress bar to the terminal along with some other useful progress information.</p>

<p>If I were to execute the task directly, I could watch the progress directly. Since we&rsquo;re running this script remotely though, this information isn&rsquo;t directly accessible.</p>

<p>In order to gain access to the progress info for this taks, we&rsquo;ll need to access the process' STDOUT from an alternate session.</p>

<p>The first step is to find the PID of the process we would like:</p>

<pre><code>ps aux | grep ruby

&gt;&gt; 1001     16544 67.7 29.4 1319420 506456 ?      Rl   13:00   3:02 ruby rake phoenix:sync_locations_from_csv
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we have the PID, we can pass this to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strace">strace</a> in order to gain a bit more insight into the current process.</p>

<pre><code>sudo strace -p 16544 -s 80 -e write 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep "write(2, \"\["
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/20140602-002.jpg"></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re redirecting the output of <em>strace</em> in order to further filter the results using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a>. Depending on what process you&rsquo;re looking to monitor you may need to adjust your grep conditions.</p>

<p>You can also exclude the redirect and grep entirely, but this may result in too much information to be useful ;)</p>
