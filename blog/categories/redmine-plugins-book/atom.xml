        <content type="html"><![CDATA[It's been over a year since this book was published, and I didn't think it would see the type of success it has.

<img class="left" src="/images/20150329-001.png">

Based on this last statement, I'm officially eligible to start collecting royalties off this book.

This will have to wait until next quarter as Packt only pays out if the total proceeds exceed Â£75; which the USD$78 I earned last quarter doesn't ;)

[Redmine](http://redmine.org) is a very popular open source project management platform, but in order to extend it users need to be familiar with not only the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) language, but the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) framework as well.

This can be quite the barrier to entry for new developers, as they need to have a fair amount of knowledge coming in.

Based on the sales figures I have access to, as well as feedback and inquiries I've received over the last year, it's safe to say that the Redmine community is thriving :)

I've updated the sales chart with my last royalty statement:

| |Ebook Mini|Subscription Packtlib Mini|Print Book Mini|Subscription (3rd Party Mini)|
|-|----------|--------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
|Q1/2014|18|3|18|0|
|Q2/2014|73|1|33|2|
|Q3/2014|25|2|24|4|
|Q4/2014|33|2|31|2|

If you're one of the people that bought the book, please leave a comment and let me know what you thought.

I'm in the process of updating the [knowledgebase plugin](https://github.com/alexbevi/redmine_knowledgebase) that served as the focal point of the book to be compatible with Redmine 3.0 and beyond. If you have any ideas for new features, or feel I should get cracking on the bug fixes, log an issue :)]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[I'd love to say Christmas came early this year, but it looks like sales of [Redmine Plugin Extension and Development](http://www.packtpub.com/redmine-plugin-extension-and-development/book) didn't quite hit the numbers needed to actually result in a royalty cheque. Ah well, there's always Q1 of 2015 :D

I've added the latest numbers to those from [my previous post](/blog/2014/09/22/second-royalty-statement/) in order to show the running total of units sold this year.

The main reason I've been sharing these numbers (without sharing that actual "numbers") is to show prospective authors what types of returns they can potentially expect.

The book I wrote falls into the "minibook" category, so the returns are lower than a full-on "book" (I think < 100 pages is a minibook), but at this rate, 2015 might result in a non-negative royalty statement that I can share :)

Happy Holidays Everyone!!!

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Although I haven't really had much to write about lately, I just got another royalty update from Packt Publishing about [Redmine Plugin Extension and Development](http://www.packtpub.com/redmine-plugin-extension-and-development/book) so I wanted to share the latest sales figures ... sort of :P

In the table below, I've added the latest numbers to those from [my previous post](/blog/2014/07/15/8748os-first-royalty-statement/) in order to show the running total of units sold this year.

Once again, I've decided to remove the actual sales numbers from the statement, but I left in *TOTAL ROYALTIES TO BE PAID IN PERIOD* section. I did this to show the progress from time of publication to now in terms of how much of the advance has been consumed by **ACTUAL** sales.

At this rate, it's possible I'll see some additional money out of this title by the time 2014 is through .. which would be very exciting.

I'm sure there are others out there who have been approached by technical publications and asked to write about some topic or other. I'm sure the numbers I'm posting here will convince you it's not worth quitting your job and writing full time, but it looks like it *could* become profitable over time.

If you've had anything published and are seeing a decent return on your "investment", please share in the comments ;)]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Just a quick update on [Redmine Plugin Extension and Development](http://www.packtpub.com/redmine-plugin-extension-and-development/book). I received my first royalty statement today, which basically just indicates that not enough books have sold to exceed the advance I received initially.

<img class="left" src="/images/royalties20140331.png">

(I probably didn't need to redact anything from the image, but it seemed appropriate.)

The deal I had with Packt was that they'd front me $600 against future sales, of which my cut is (I believe) ~ 16% of the list price.

Still a ways to go (sales-wise) before I would consider this a "profitable" venture, but it's nice to see that there is at least some initial interest.

I was approached by Packt a little while back to author another book, but based on the amount of time I invested in this one as well as the sales figures I'm sharing here, I don't think it would be a good choice :P

Should I consider writing another book? Any thoughts out there from my fellow denizens of the interwebs?

Well, it's official. The journey I began over six months ago has finally come to an end, and [Redmine Plugin Extension and Development](http://www.packtpub.com/redmine-plugin-extension-and-development/book) has officially been published :)

I plan on doing a "post-mortem" on the process at some point, but for now I'm planning on taking a little time off from writing.]]></content>
