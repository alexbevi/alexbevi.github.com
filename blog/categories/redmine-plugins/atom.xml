    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the last 4 months I&rsquo;ve been working with <a href="http://www.packtpub.com">Packt Publishing</a> on a book about <a href="http://www.redmine.org">Redmine</a> plugin extension and development.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/8748OS_mockupcover_normal_0.jpg"></p>

<p>The book is available for <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/redmine-plugin-extension-and-development/book">pre-order on Packt&rsquo;s site</a>.</p>

<p>Since the book is <em>almost</em> through the first stage of rewrites, I though it might be a good idea to start documenting the process.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;m going to write about initially are my first impressions on writing a book, as well as a few notes (which may sound like complaints) about what I did &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; and could improve upon in the future.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Originally, I wasn&rsquo;t sure that I would be a good choice as an author as I didn&rsquo;t have the community recognition that some other plugin developers had, and I hadn&rsquo;t been &ldquo;on the scene&rdquo; for more than a few years.</p>

<p>After much consideration, I decided to dive in and start writing.</p>

<p>The first step was to provide the publisher with a rough outline that also included the page count. Initially, I just threw together a handful of topics that I wanted to cover, then (very generically) estimated how many pages I would need to completely cover those topics.</p>

<p>Once approved, and I actually <em>started</em> writing, I very quickly realized that meeting my page estimates was almost impossible; some chapters would be way too short, and others WAY too long.</p>

<p>I also had to provide a rough outline as to how long I thoght it would take me to write each chapter. This step, in retrospect, I wish I had taken more time to properly prepare.</p>

<p>Writing a technically-oriented book involves a lot more research than you may think (no matter how well you think you know the source material). As such, the further I got into the book, the more time I found myself researching, writing code, testing code, then writing about the code I&rsquo;d built.</p>

<p>This process took a good 3x longer than I anticipated, and as such, my deadlines tended to slip by. As a result, the tentative release date for the final book of January 2014 is not very likely.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that this blog post will also serve as a motivator to get my ass in gear and finish the final revisions.</p>
