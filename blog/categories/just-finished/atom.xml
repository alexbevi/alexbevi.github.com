Although I'm a huge fan of the point-and-click adventure genre, I've been primarily focusing on covering 16-bit RPGs in my spare time. I've still got a sizeable backlog to wade through, but when the news dropped that [Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_Adventures:_Lord_of_the_Clans) had been leaked, I couldn't resist.

Although no one really got a taste of this game until 2010 when MAN-biker posted some content to Youtube, I'd been inquiring with Blizzard as early as 2008. I still have a copy of the email, so I've trimmed it down a bit and shared it below.

This isn&#39;t really a support question, and I have no idea how to route this
properly, but the question I want to ask is as follows:

Over the years, I&#39;m sure there have been numerous attempts by fans to get Blizzard 
to revive the Warcraft Adventures project. The statement made when it was cancelled 
was that it didn&#39;t meet the quality requirements that Blizzard was trying to keep 
for it&#39;s users; and over the years, those decisions have resulted in excellent titles.

Regarding Warcraft Adventures though, it&#39;s been 10 years since this project was 
cancelled. I don&#39;t have any inside information into the level of completion the 
project was at, but if it was &#39;near&#39; completion, couldn&#39;t this be released to the 
open-source community to be added to a project such as ScummVM? The benefit here 
would be positive PR for Blizzard, as well as renewed interest in their catalog of 
games to a number of new users.

I don&#39;t represent the ScummVM team, but I&#39;d be interested to know what you 
guys think. -Alex

Greetings Alex,

Thank you for emailing the Blizzard technical support department in regards 
to your question.  I know the same question has been asked by others in the 
past and unfortunately there just is not information in regards to the game 
that I have available to give besides what is already available on the internet.  
Unfortunately I have no way to request any further information about the game or 
items such as art resources or code from the game. 

The best place I can suggest to post such a request is on our suggestions forum 
at http://forums.battle.net/board.html?forumId=12016&amp;sid=3000.  This is by employees 
that have more information, and more access to information than we do here in 
technical support, if there is a large enough interest in anything then those ideas 
are passed along to those that may be able to do more.  I cant guarantee anything 
unfortunately but this is the best location I can suggest to try for such a request.


Regards,
Peter N.

My hope was to get access to the source code for the [ScummVM](http://www.scummvm.org/) team to be able to incorporate as a custom engine.

Unfortunately (though not unsurprisingly), Blizzard wouldn't release the code.

Now, once word got out that the complete game had been released (not legally I know ...), I had to grab it and give it a shot.

Being a game from the late 90's, I didn't expect it to just work. My primary machines run Linux, so I first tried to run this through [wine](https://www.winehq.org/), which didn't end up working reliably.

I then built a Windows XP VM using VirtualBox. This managed to run 
the game with no issues.

### Story

As per the [Gamepedia](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Warcraft_Adventures:_Lord_of_the_Clans) article:

Basically, after the Dark Portal was destroyed and the rift between the worlds was destroyed, you had a large group of orcs that were trapped on Azeroth. And over the course of the next few years, the humans, being merciful in their ways, instead of hunting down and eradicating these orcs, granted them land areas where they could live as long as they lived within the confines of societal expectations. Basically, they were put on these reservations or camps. And because they were made to live in a way that was very contrary to their basic nature, a lot of the spirit and fire that defines them as a culture was drained out of them. And so what you found yourself with was an orc society in Azeroth of forced passivity, not forced through violence but forced through situation.
Although down on their luck, the orcs in Warcraft Adventures were supposed to experience a rebirth, thanks to the leadership of Thrall.

<img class="left" src="/images/wca/wca.10.png">

Our storyline followed an orc baby that was taken from a battle scene where his parents were slain and raised by a human lieutenant, Blackmoore, with the intention of raising him with human ideals but being able to use him to control the orcs. Definitely someone who does not fit into the general stereotype of noble humans. He was a self-serving, dark human character who wanted to raise this orc, Thrall, our central character in the game, and use him to control and command the orcs and then raise them as his own private army. Thrall, though he's raised in captivity by humans to serve their will, still has some fire within him that he can't deny, so he rebels against his human owners. He escapes the compound where he's being held, and then over the course of the game, what we do is follow his adventures. As he discovers more about himself and the orcs and what it means to be an orc, so does the player. As you go through the game, you meet some familiar faces from the games, some in retirement, some trying to lead an underground resistance, and you learn of what happened to the Frost Wolf Clan, which was the clan that Thrall's father Durotan was a part of. You learn that Durotan, Blackhand and Doomhammer were three blood brothers, and that his clan Frost Wolf was sent into the Dwarf Highlands in the mountains. They were exiled there by a plotting Ner'zhul, when he was pulling the strings in the background behind Doom Hammer and Black Hand, because he knew that Durotan was a threat.

### Gameplay

When I first started playing WCA, it was a nice trip down memory lane. The gameplay mechanics really seemed to borrow heavily from [Full Throttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Throttle_\(1995_video_game\)), which was one of my favourite point-and-click adventures in the '90s. 

<img class="right" src="/images/wca/wca.05.png">

Right-clicking brings up a graphical command menu that lets you talk, look or use.

You can interact with the environment based on designated hotspots (which are identified when hovered by showing a label).

Thrall will usually try to respond with a funny comment whenever possible, which makes it more compelling to click around and see what he has to say about his surroundings.

### Puzzles

As with most adventure games of this era, the puzzles are predominantly fetch-quests and inventory manipulation quests. Again, if you grew up with these games this type of mechanic is old hat, but if you're new to the genre, this can seem a bit tedious.

I found that the puzzles were a bit on the easy side (until the last 10 minutes of the game). This could just be because I'm used to these sorts of games, but until I need to dig around in the dragon's stomach for the pig's jetpack, everything was straightforward and I didn't feel the need to look to Google for the answer.

## Overall

As a throwback to '90s point-and-click adventures, I'd say WCA is worth playing. If you enjoyed the genre, this is a no brainer, and if you've never played this type of game, this is a pretty easy entry.

The version of the game that was leaked is pretty close to being completed. I didn't notice any issues or major omissions.

The quality of the FMVs are pretty low compared to other games from the late '90s. The pacing of the game isn't too slow and the story is interesting enough to make you want to see it through to the end.

Playing Warcraft Adventures actually made me want to revisit some other adventure games. I get the urge to play through Day of the Tentacle every 4-5 years or so, and I think it's been almost that long ...

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[I actually finished this game around the end of June, but haven't really had a chance to write about it until now. I'm currently sitting out by the lake at the cottage and figured it was about time :P

<img class="left" src="/images/dq1/dq1.000.png">

The last time I played through Dragon Quest was likely in the late 80's. I'm pretty sure I either heard about it, or got a copy of it through Nintendo Power, and like most kids in North America at the time, this would have been my first introduction to what would become known as JRPGs.

I decided to go with the SNES re-release of this title for my playthrough as I wanted some updated graphics and music. Although the SNES version was never officially localized for North America, there is an [excellent fan translation](http://www.romhacking.net/translations/337/) available.

It threw me off a bit when they refer to the legendary hero as Roto (as opposed to Erdrick), but I'm assuming this is a better translation than what we got in the 80's so that's probably what the name should have been in the first place.

<img class="right" src="/images/dq1/dq1.001.png">

Dragon Quest was essentially the first JRPG. As a result, there are a lot of concepts introduced here that would be adapted and refined by other titles and series over the years. This means that some parts of this game feel a bit rough or unbalanced.

I originally played the NES version of this title, and have fond memories of just how brutally hard it was. This game introduced me to what I would come to know as "grinding", as you couldn't progress through the game unless your character was sufficiently leveled up in order to tackle the monsters in the areas you were exploring.

This meant walking back and forth and fighting random monsters. 

Enemy encounter rates are high. Very high. I think the SNES version actually optimized this a bit, but the rates are still high. This is useful for grinding, but gets tedious when you want to explore, or really need to get back to a town to heal.

The story is pretty simple.

You're the descendant of the legendary hero, and have been tasked with rescuing the princess and defeating the Dragon Lord.

<!-- more -->

<img class="left" src="/images/dq1/dq1.001.png">

To defeat the Dragon Lord, you need to get three pieces of equipment of the legendary hero which are scattered across the world.

Beat the dragon. Save the princess. Beat the Dragon Lord. Done.

Gameplay is pretty straightforward. You start off in the castle, where the king explains your quest. You can talk to people in the castle, or leave and move on to the nearest town.

Here you'll get a bit more info, or can buy supplies.

I think it's kind of cool that the first time you leave the castle you can see the Dragon Lord's castle on the world map. This gives you your target right away and you know what you're working towards.

You interact with NPCs and the world via a command menu. One of the nice additions to the SNES version is that you no longer have to use a STAIRS command to go up and down stairs; just walk over them.

<img class="right" src="/images/dq1/dq1.012.png">

As you roam around the overworld and dungeouns, you'll get into random encounters. You interact with these using a command menu as well, where you can select to either attack, use magic, use an item, or run. 

Dragon Quest is a pretty short game. Being one of the first of this genre it introduced a lot of gameplay elements that would shape the genre, but when you look at it as a standalone title, there's not all that much there.

This isn't meant to be a knock at the game. I had a great time playing through it, but that playthrough was only a few hours.

I used an emulator to do this, so most of my level grinding was done in fast-forward, so it felt even faster to get through this title.

If you're playing the "classics", I'd definitely recommend this title. Playing these early games gives you more of an appreciation for the later RPGs, as well as giving you a feel for how it all started.

Have you had a chance to play this title? How do you think it holds up nowadays, especially with the release of the mobile ports? Have any DQ memories you want to share? Let me know in the comments.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[I had this game finished around Christmas, but I find my motivation for writing these articles is starting to languish. I'm hoping to get that spark back with the next couple of titles i'll be tackling, even though Shadownrun was one of my favourite SNES games of all time.

<img class="right" src="/images/shadowrun/shadowrun.001.png">

You wake up on a slab in the morgue. You don't know who you are or how you got there. That's pretty much all you've got to go on when you start this game for the first time.

The intro shows you being gunned down, then a shapeshifter casts a spell on you and takes off. After getting out of the morgue, you run into "Dog", who appears to be a shamanistic totem.

This was the first 10 minutes of this game, and I remember playing this back in '94 and being hooked at this point.

[Shadowrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_(1993_video_game\)) is a cyberpunk action-RPG for the Super Nintendo. You control Jake Armitage, a courier who has something important uploaded to his head computer. 

<!-- more -->

You move around in an isometric fashion. You can interact with certain people by talking to them, or occasionally giving them a key item from your inventory.

<img class="left" src="/images/shadowrun/shadowrun.005.png">

When talking to NPCs, some words will appear in bold. These can then be used as keywords in future conversations. These NPC interactions are how the story is progressed, and you'll spend a fair amount of time in this menu over the course of the game.

Once you learn the *Hiring* keyword, you can also try to hire additional shadowrunners. When they join your team, they will fight along side you ... for a while. If you've increased your leadership levels, they may stay longer.

Leveling up is done by spending karma when you rest on a bed (which also acts as a save point). You can spend your karma to boost various stats, or to level up your spells once you learn magic.

Karma is gained by fighting, which is done by moving a set of cross-hairs across the screen, and when placed over an enemy, mashing the A button. You then fire, wait, fire, wait ... etc.

<img class="right" src="/images/shadowrun/shadowrun.010.png">

The combat in this game is pretty simple. Just stand in one place and fire. Once you're in combat mode, you can move your character, so there's not really any strategy (other than healing on occasion).

The same system is used for spells and items. You select the (spell/item) from the menu, the cursor becomes a hand icon, and you hover over your target and press a button again.

Navigating the screen using the D-pad can be a bit cumbersome; especially when fighting, but you get used to it after a while.

The game seems to be made up of a series of fetch quests that are used to get you from NPC to NPC in order to uncover more keywords, to then be used with other NPCs to trigger more fetch quests. Oh, and move the story along as well ;)

<img class="left" src="/images/shadowrun/shadowrun.006.png">

The game is split up into 3 main areas that you can navigate to by train, one area you get to by boat, and the volcano you get to by helicopter. These areas are all opened up as the story moves along and you slowly uncover who was responsible for trying to geek you at the beginning of the game.

As you fight your way through the various areas, you'll find out that you were a courier with sensitive information in your head computer. You have a datajack in your head which is not working, so you can't access your brain by computer in order to get this information.

When you go find a street doc to fix your datajack, it triggers a cortex bomb that then needs to be defused. After this is done, you get some information about what's in your head and you can start decking (hacking) into computers.

<img class="right" src="/images/shadowrun/shadowrun.019.png">

The decking segments are actually pretty dumb, but I love them. This is really what has kept me going back to this game time and again over the years, as I just really loved the concept.

You're physically wired into this machine, and have to battle various security countermeasures that have been installed in these systems. The battles are done by guessing when there is a hidden enemy on a grid and pressing the A button. Based on an RNG value and your computer skill level, you'll either miss or destroy the enemy.

That's it. That's all there is to it. I still love it though :P

Depending on why you were hacking in, you'll either trigger an elevator or get part of a data file. The data files are plot devices that give you bits of the story, or contain phone numbers you can use from vidphones throughout the game.

<img class="left" src="/images/shadowrun/shadowrun.024.png">

After you've finally fought your way through the various sections of the game, you finally get to face off against Drake. He's apparently the one behind you almost being whacked. You beat him up, head back to Akimi building, fight your way up a handful of floors (fighting and decking) and finally find the AI you need to destroy.

Once done, things explode, and you can close the books on this adventure. 

The game alludes to there being a potential sequel in the works, but this never materialized. There was another Shadownrun title for [Sega Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_(1994_video_game\)), but this was a completely different game. I might play through this and do a write up one day, but I've tried playing it a couple times over the years and could never get into it (if you think I should, or want to share an opinion, there is a comments section below ... :P).

<img class="right" src="/images/shadowrun/shadowrun.027.png">

Overall I still love this game. This is where I was introduced to cyberpunk as a kid, and I even went as far as getting the Shadowrun books ([Never Deal with a Dragon](http://www.amazon.com/Never-Deal-Dragon-Shadownrun-Vol/dp/0451450787)) that this game was very loosely based on.

The music was also a fantastic complement to the dark atmosphere of the game. [3AM On A Summer Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ome6XI_KuIw&list=PL2D5FC9FCF1AEF68C&index=2) might actually be one of my favourite tracks from the 16-bit era that wasn't composed by Nobuo Uematsu ;)

If you're revisiting the SNES and looking for something you may have overlooked during the mid '90s, pick this up and give it a spin.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img class="right" src="/images/ffv/ffv.001.png">

I've been waiting write this review for a very long time. I love the Final Fantasy series, and although I got the original back in '90, I didn't really fall in love with the series until I played IV for the SNES. Then I played VI. Then I was REALLY hooked.

Since I didn't grow up in Japan, FF IV and VI were numbered II and III when I first got my hands on them. This means that I didn't know there was a [Final Fantasy V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_V); at least not until much later.

The game starts off with the king of Tycoon heading off to check on the wind crystal, only to watch it shatter. The hero Bartz (Butz when I played the fan translation :P) sees a meteorite fall from the sky and heads off to investigate. Bartz and his Chocobo go to check it out, and find an old man who's suffering from amnesia.

The king's daughter, Lenna, heads out to find her father and runs into Bartz and Galuf. They team up and the adventure begins.

<img class="left" src="/images/ffv/ffv.003.png">

Once at the wind shrine, they find that the crystal has shattered and within each shard is the power of a job class.

This introduces you to the job ability system. If you've ever had a chance to play [Final Fantasy III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_III), you've see this system in action, but in FFV, it's done to perfection :)

<!-- more -->

Each character can be assigned to a job class. As they defeat enemies, they gain ability points, which levels up the job class. As the classes level up, you gain abilities associated with that class.

These abilities can then be applied to a character regardless of the class they're assigned to. For example, you can give a white mage black magic abilities (if you've leveled up a black mage for that character).

This gives you a lot of control over how you build your characters as the game progresses.

<img class="right" src="/images/ffv/ffv.002.png">

The storytelling in this game is very well done. Although the plot is pretty standard Final Fantasy fare (crystals, amnesia, evil emperor, main characters dying), the writing was pretty good and the character emotion pop-ups added a nice touch as well.

I enjoyed the elements of comedy they tried to incorporate into some of the scenarios and characters. After playing this game, Gilgamesh is probably my new favourite non-player character in the series. This might also have to do with [Clash on the Big Bridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CMTXyExkeI)
being my favourite song from this game ;)

<img class="left" src="/images/ffv/ffv.022.png">

The battle system is the same as in FFIV ([Active Time Battle system](http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_System#Active_Time_Battle)). You can fight, use items, or up to 2 abilities you've learned from gaining AP and leveling up your classes.

I didn't find the battles overly difficult during this play-through, but I've been focusing a lot on grinding in the last few games I've covered, so this could just be a result of me over leveling.

So as you progress through the game, you discover that the ultimate evil, Exdeath, was banished to your world by the four warriors of dawn. Now you and your party need to become the new warriors of dawn to fight him again.

<img class="right" src="/images/ffv/ffv.046.png">

You have to get the ultimate weapons for each character class, you can go on some side quests to get some powerful summons and eventually go after Exdeath.

There is one fight in Exdeath's tower that I just couldn't win, and that was [Shinryu](http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Shinryu_(Final_Fantasy_V)). I didn't bother to upgrade my equipment after a while as I just hoarded my money to use Gil Toss against everybody. As a result, Shinryu just decimated me every time I tried ... so I just gave up.

I found that magic and summons in this game proved to be effective until the very end. This is different than my experience with FF II, where you bust your ass to get Ultima, then it does like 900 damage to enemies (even after being leveled up a few times :|).

I thought the story was really compelling, and I found the whole alternate worlds overlapping "thing" to be a nice twist, though it felt a bit like what happened in FF III. Actually, just like FF III, you even have to race a chocobo around the world to get an item ...

<img class="left" src="/images/ffv/ffv.037.png">

I teared up (just a bit) when Galuf's flame was extinguished by Exdeath. I was a bit worried that since this game follows FF IV it was possible they would do the whole "everyone who died is magically back to fight again for no reason" that happened with Yang, Cid, Edward, Tellah ... etc. Fortunately (?), this wasn't the case and it's actually a very emotional point in the story.

I would strongly recommend any fan of JRPGs spend some time on this title. If I were ranking my favourite FFs now, Final Fantasy V would probably show up in the top 5 :)

As for where I'm going from here, I'm currently about 6-8 hours into [Pokémon Emerald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Emerald). I'm sort of enjoying it, though it feels like a watered down version of [Earthbound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthBound) (just my initial impression).

I'm also about 4-5 hours into [Tales of Destiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Destiny), but I'm not really enjoying this title and likely won't go back to it.

Feel free to leave me some feedback on whether or not I should continue the above, or if you've got a recommendation for the next title I tackle.

Cheers!

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img class="right" src="/images/lufia2/lufia2.000.png">

This review has been a long time coming; a *VERY* long time coming. I heard about [Lufia 2: Rise of the Sinistrals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufia_II:_Rise_of_the_Sinistrals) when I was still in high school, and have been meaning to play it ever since.

Back then, I was just starting to get into JRPGs (though I probably just thought they were RPGs at the time) and was completely infatuated with anything that Square or Enix could crank out (except for [Earthbound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthBound), which is still one of my all-time faves).

In the decade(s) since my teens, I've picked up Lufia 2 a good dozen times, but have never really given it a fair shake. This time around though, since I'm doing this "Just Finished" series, I thought I'd finally sit down and do a full playthrough.

For anyone that has not played this game: PLAY IT! Lufia 2 is now in the top 10 of my favourite 16-bit JRPGs of all time. Hopefully after reading my synopsis here, anyone that was on the fence will also take the plunge (you'll thank me later!).

<!-- more -->

## Overview

Lufia 2 (aka. Estpolis Denki II, aka. エストポリス伝記II) is a hybrid of traditional JRPG and [Action RPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_role-playing_game). You control one to four characters at a time throughout the adventure, with enemy encounters being handled via fade-away to a turn-based combat system.

It turns out you (Maxim) are destined to fight the Sinistrals, so you embark on a journey to save the world. Cliché? Yup :P

Don't get me wrong, I love a good "destined to save the world" story, but after playing a handful of JRPGs in succession, I was getting a bit numb to the same story over and over again.

<img class="left" src="/images/lufia2/lufia2.026.png">

I decided to give this a fair chance though, and went along with it. I had never played the original [Lufia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufia) for more than 5-10 minutes, but I do remember the intro segment where you have the four heroes already in the Fortress of Doom getting ready to fight the Sinistrals.

I'm going to skip around a bit here because I just want to cover one thing, which is the end of the game ... first. The final battle with Daos for Maxim, Artea, Guy and Selan is the EXACT scene from the first game. This made me REALLY want to go back and play the first game, as I now had a connection with the characters.

Also, I thought I was a really cool transition as it tied the two games together seamlessly.

### Combat

<img class="left" src="/images/lufia2/lufia2.032.png">

Enemy encounters on the overworld are random. As you're walking around, suddenly the screen will zoom in and boom, it's go time! For anyone familiar with JRPGs, this is pretty common.

Unlike traditional RPGs, Lufia 2 doesn't have "random" encounters in dungeons. All enemies are visible as you explore the dungeons, and though most will chase you, a lot of these battles can be avoided if you so choose.

<img class="right" src="/images/lufia2/lufia2.005.png">

Once a battle is initiated, as opposed to a text-based menu of `Fight | Magic | Item | Run` as you might see in some games, you're presented with an icon cross (reminiscent of [Breath of Fire](/blog/2015/06/10/just-finished-breath-of-fire/)).

Aside from the standard Attack, Item and Magic options, there is also and Abilities option for each party member. This additional entry gives each character access to various offensive or defensive abilities that are linked to their weapons and armour. This adds another dimension to battles as you have to keep track of what skills are linked to your equipment (don't just hit 'optimize' each time) as weaker items may provide added benefits against certain enemies.

### Puzzles

<img class="left" src="/images/lufia2/lufia2.004.png">

What I really enjoyed about this game from the moment I entered the first dungeon was the puzzles. Littered throughout each dungeon are puzzles that you need to solve in order to open a door and proceed.

Generally, these puzzles aren't all that complex, but they break up the dungeons a bit so it doesn't feel monotonous as you basically do the same things over and over in order to progress the story.

As you move further through the game, you also collect various key items, that can be used in order to help solve the various puzzles (bombs, arrows, hook shot, etc.)

<img class="right" src="/images/lufia2/lufia2.021.png">

These add another dimension to the puzzles that keeps them interesting. I honestly didn't find most puzzles to be very challenging, but I will admit to having to use a walkthrough for at least 2 of them ... (thankfully there are excellent [guides on rpgclassics](http://shrines.rpgclassics.com/snes/lufia2/puzzles.shtml) for just these instances where you need a tiny bit of help)

### Party

Your party is made up of Maxim, and at various points Tia, Guy, Selan, Dekar and Arty.

<img class="left" src="/images/lufia2/lufia2.019.png">

Tia is from your home village and follows you on the initial leg of the quest. You think she's going to end up being Maxim's love interest, but that changes once Selan enters the story ;)

Maxim and Selan fall in love, get married, and have a baby. This all happens around the mid-point of the game, acting as a bit of an intermission. Once they have the kid, they decide to go back out and fight so that the world is safe for their baby (and everyone else ... I guess).

<img class="right" src="/images/lufia2/lufia2.028.png">

Guy joins as he's a good fighter and wants to help defeat the Sinistrals. Dekar's reasons are basically the same.

### Capsule Monsters

Your party can also include capsule monsters. These are optional encounters throughout the game that if you seek out result in an additional character being able to join you in battle.

<img class="left" src="/images/lufia2/lufia2.018.png">

Each monster has an elemental affiliation, and can level up with you as you fight enemies. If the capsule monster dies in battle though, they respawn for the next fight, so there's no need to worry about their health (you can't heal them). They do tend to run from a lot of battles automatically though, which can be annoying.

Capsule monsters can also be made stronger by leveling them up through feeding them weapons, armour and items.

This got a bit annoying as I had to hear a lot of "Yuk"s from the monsters while trying to find the right items to feed them.

### Music

I just quickly wanted to touch on the music in this game. For a JRPG not composed by [Nobuo](http://vgmdb.net/artist/77), the soundtrack is pretty solid.

If you've got a minute, check out a couple of songs below to get a taste of what's in store for you ;)

* [Final Battle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Fzm2O4Zt-k&index=44&list=PL6BB4862ADAA12E48)
* [Peace of Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E-AD-OUxKg&list=PL6BB4862ADAA12E48&index=10)
* [The Lost World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fk3omXPfuVM&list=PL6BB4862ADAA12E48&index=41)
* [Battle Theme 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLIrE5ivseQ&list=PL6BB4862ADAA12E48&index=46)

In case you're wondering, composition credit goes to [Yasunori Shiono](http://vgmdb.net/artist/313).

### Ancient Cave

This is a completely optional dungeon, but if you're going to play Lufia 2, you HAVE to try and clear it ;)

The ancient cave is 99 randomly generated floors, and you start the cave at level 1 (no matter where you actually are in the game). As you level up and descend further into the cave, you find various treasures and spells that you can only use within the cave.

If you warp out, you lose all experience and items you've found; aside from items in blue chests (which are few).

<img class="right" src="/images/lufia2/lufia2.038.png">

Once you make it to the last level of the cave, you fight the Master Jelly. This is a brutal fight, as you only have 3 turns in order to beat him, and if you don't, he just runs and that's the end of it (you have to warp out).

Note that I basically cheated to beat him. If you can kill your entire party before he runs, you'll actually win the fight.

I did this, but I didn't find all the Iris Treasures in the cave so it didn't really matter.

## Summary

As great as you probably think I think this game is by now, it is not without its faults.

First off, this game is *extremely* linear. The plot progresses as follows:

* Go to <tower name> tower to find <plot point>
* Climb tower and fight enemy
* Go back to town to learn where next town is
* Go to shrine to advance to next town

Sure you get a boat at a certain point and it "opens" up the map, but you still basically go from town to town and tower to tower without much variety.

Also, it may be that I'm just a bit more experienced in the genre and know how to level grind, but I found this game to be very, very easy. By the final dungeon, every battle was essentially the same (the final boss included): fight, fight, valor, fight.

All in all though, I really enjoyed this game. Although the story seemed like it was going to be pretty basic at the outset turned out the be really compelling.

There was actually quite a bit of character development. I think this is why at the end when you realize you're basically setting up the intro of Lufia I, you really want to go back and play that game to see if the story continues to be as strong.

I'll probably give this game another run through in a few years, as it really was enjoyable. I tend to do this with RPGs i enjoy as I forget specifics of the story over the years and enjoy rediscovering them. Final Fantasy IV and VI have had this treatment now probably a good 4-5 times each ;)
