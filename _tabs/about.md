The name's Alex, and I'm currently a Senior Product Manager on the Developer Interfaces team at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), focusing on the Node.js and Ruby Developer Ecosystems.

I've been writing software professionally since 2000, and have had the opportunity to flex my creative muscle in a number of languages and technologies.

Recently, my projects have been been in [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), but am also experienced in [Adobe Flex](http://www.adobe.com/ca/products/flex.html), [Adobe AIR](http://www.adobe.com/ca/products/air.html), [Python](http://www.python.org/), [C#](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)), [C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), [Java](http://www.java.com/en/), [HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)/[Javascript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [Actionscript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript), [VisualBasic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic), [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/), [Bash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash).

I'm also the author of a book on [Redmine Plugin Extension and Development](https://www.packtpub.com/product/redmine-plugin-extension-and-development/9781783288748), which is available from [Packt Publishing](http://www.packtpub.com).

## Presentations

As part of my current role I'm trying to do more public speaking. Here are some examples of presentations I've delivered - even if they weren't all recorded.

* `2023-04-01`: Learning Bytes \| _Mongoose ODM with MongoDB_ ([video](https://learn.mongodb.com/learn/course/mongoose-odm-with-mongodb/learning-byte/learn))
* `2023-01-24`: Ruby on Rails Global Summit'23 \| _Ruby on Rails and MongoDB_ ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCdVBOJI3Ow&list=TLPQMjQwMTIwMjMqueSlzDsFKg&t=17872s))
* `2019-11-21`: MongoDB.local Toronto 2019 \| _Tips and Tricks for Effective Indexing_ ([slides](https://www.slideshare.net/mongodb/mongodb-local-toronto-2019-tips-and-tricks-for-effective-indexing))
* `2019-06-17`: MongoDB World 2019 \| _The Sights (and Smells) of a Bad Query_ ([slides](https://www.slideshare.net/mongodb/mongodb-world-2019-the-sights-and-smells-of-a-bad-query))

## Software Engineering for Fun!

To keep the skill-set sharp, I enjoy [reverse engineering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering) old DOS and Windows games. The goal is usually to build an engine which can then be included with [ScummVM](http://www.scummvm.org).

I'm also an active [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) developer, and enjoy hacking on [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org) plugins.

## Software Engineering for Profit!

Though I don't have a lot of free time lately, if the right project for the right client were to come along, I would definitely want to hear what you had to say :)
