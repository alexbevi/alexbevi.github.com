MongoDB Specifications are available at [github.com/mongodb/specifications](https://github.com/mongodb/specifications), and were recently worked from being restructuredText files to Markdown files. I wrote about these specs in greater detail in my post about ["Peeling the MongoDB Drivers Onion"]({% post_url 2024-05-17-peeling-the-mongodb-drivers-onion %}), but I've since added some automation to build these specs out as a book using [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/).

If this page doesn't redirect automatically, the specifications can also be found hosted at [alexbevi.com/specifications/](https://alexbevi.com/specifications/).
