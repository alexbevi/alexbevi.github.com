The TAS Movie Editor (formerly the TAS Movie Splicer) is a project I started for editing TAS input files over at [TASVideos](http://tasvideos.org)

The project began in September, 2009 out of a personal need for some tools to manipulate a run I was working on (and subsequently never finished) for Shadowrun (SNES).
