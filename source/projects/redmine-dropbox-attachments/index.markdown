Use [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com) as the storage backend for your [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org) installation

#### Installation

To install the plugin, execute the following commands from the root of your redmine directory:
    
    cd plugins
    git clone git://github.com/alexbevi/redmine_dropbox_attachments.git
    bundle install

More information on installing Redmine plugins can be found at [redmine.org](http://www.redmine.org/wiki/redmine/Plugins.)

After the plugin is installed you will need to restart Redmine for the plugin to be available.

#### Configuration

The plugin must be configured from `Administration > Plugins > Dropbox Attachment Storage > Configure`

##### Authorization

Before Redmine can store files on a shared Dropbox folder, it must be authorized. This is done by clicking _Authorize Redmine with Dropbox_, then selecting _Allow_ from Dropbox's authorization page.

##### Specifying a Base Directory

By default, the plugin will write to your Dropbox's `Apps > redmine_files` directory.

If you specify a *Base Directory* value, that subdirectory will be creted under Apps/redmine_files and used to store attachements for the plugin.

##### Storing Attachments for Multiple Redmine's

Since you can only register a single instance of this plugin with Dropbox, if you want to store attachments for multiple installations of Redmine, the steps are:

1) Authorize the plugin _ONCE_ with Dropbox

2) Copy the _Dropbox Token_ and _Dropbox Secret_ values from the authorized installation

3) Paste the token/secret values to each additional installation

Note that if you have multiple installations, it's a good idea to specify different base directories.

#### Acknowledgement

This plugin is heavily based on the [Redmine S3](https://github.com/tigrish/redmine_s3) plugin. Thanks to all the contributors there who've made this such an easy plugin to build ;)

I also used the [Redmine DropBox](https://github.com/zuinqstudio/redmine_drop_box) plugin to find some quick answers to interacting with dropbox.
