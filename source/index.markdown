The name's Alex, and I'm a full time Application Developer at [Astley Gilbert Limited](http://www.astleygilbert.com) in Toronto.

I've been writing software professionally since 2000, and have had the opportunity to flex my creative muscle in a number of lanugages and technologies.

Recently, my projects have been been in [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), but am also experienced in [Adobe Flex](http://www.adobe.com/ca/products/flex.html), [Adobe AIR](http://www.adobe.com/ca/products/air.html), [Python](http://www.python.org/), [C#](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language), [C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), [Java](http://www.java.com/en/), [HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)/[Javascript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [Actionscript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript), [VisualBasic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic), [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/), [Bash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash).

## Software Engineering for Fun!

To keep the skillset sharp, I enjoy [reverse engineering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering) old DOS and Windows games. The goal is usually to build an engine which can then be included with [ScummVM](http://www.scummvm.org).

I'm also an active [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) developer, and enjoy hacking on [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org) plugins.

## Software Engineering for Profit!

Though I don't have a lot of free time lately, if the right project for the right client were to come along, I would definitely want to hear what you had to say :)
