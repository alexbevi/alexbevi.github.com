I'm a big fan of [Anime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime), and figured I'd share what I've currently got kicking around in my [Plex](https://plex.tv) library at the moment.

I'm generating this using a script I found [here](https://github.com/Dachande663/Plex-Export) (with some minor tweaks to get it working in jekyll/octopress).

I figure I'll write some reviews as I get through certain series and share them here. 

If you think I'm missing anything awesome, let me know in the comments below ;)
