This is just a quick update that I've finally finished the first round of rewrites for the upcoming [Redmine Plugin Extension and Development](http://www.packtpub.com/redmine-plugin-extension-and-development/book) book.

The issue I was struggling with was little more than a complete lack of motivation. Since I work full time and do contract development on the side (plus have a wife and kids), yet another distraction can be difficult to find time for; especially if it's not a primary source of income.

[Packt Publishing](http://www.packtpub.com) has been very patient with me though so I'm going to try to find the time in the coming week to get through the second round of revisions and rewrites and hopefully get this puppy to market ;)
