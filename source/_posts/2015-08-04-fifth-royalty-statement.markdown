I've been meaning to write this post for a long time, as I officially got the royalty statement at the end of June, but I've been a bit busy with life, contracts and the occasional 16-bit era JRPG ...

As of this quarter, [Redmine Plugin Extension and Development](http://www.packtpub.com/redmine-plugin-extension-and-development/book) is officially earning me money!

Technically, the last statement was [in the black](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in_the_black), however since the terms laid out by Packt Publishing only pays out royalties greater than Â£75, those earnings were rolled into this quarter.

I've updated the table below with the numbers from the current quarter, but I'd really like to thank everyone who's bought a copy of this book for supporting the [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org/) project, and the vibrant plugin development community as well.
