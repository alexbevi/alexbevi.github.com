So, another year, another blogging engine, another crack at blogging.

This time around I'm trying out [Octopress](http://octopress.org). There's something very appealing about being able to interact with this blog via rake tasks and [Git](http://git-scm.com).

Octopress is essentially [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/), which means it can be deployed very easily to either [Github](https://github.com) or [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com).

Why all the links you may ask? Because I can write posts using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown), and I sometimes mix up the syntax between Markdown and [Textile](http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/), so I'm just trying to hammer it into my brain ;)
