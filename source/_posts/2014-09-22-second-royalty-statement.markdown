Although I haven't really had much to write about lately, I just got another royalty update from Packt Publishing about [Redmine Plugin Extension and Development](http://www.packtpub.com/redmine-plugin-extension-and-development/book) so I wanted to share the latest sales figures ... sort of :P

Once again, I've decided to remove the actual sales numbers from the statement, but I left in *TOTAL ROYALTIES TO BE PAID IN PERIOD* section. I did this to show the progress from time of publication to now in terms of how much of the advance has been consumed by **ACTUAL** sales.

At this rate, it's possible I'll see some additional money out of this title by the time 2014 is through .. which would be very exciting.

I'm sure there are others out there who have been approached by technical publications and asked to write about some topic or other. I'm sure the numbers I'm posting here will convince you it's not worth quitting your job and writing full time, but it looks like it *could* become profitable over time.

If you've had anything published and are seeing a decent return on your "investment", please share in the comments ;)
