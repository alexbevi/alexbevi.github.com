Just a quick update on [Redmine Plugin Extension and Development](http://www.packtpub.com/redmine-plugin-extension-and-development/book). I received my first royalty statement today, which basically just inidicates that not enough books have sold to exceed the advance I received initially.

(I probably didn't need to redact anything from the image, but it seemed appropriate.)

The deal I had with Packt was that they'd front me $600 against future sales, of which my cut is (I believe) ~ 16% of the list price.

Still a ways to go (sales-wise) before I would consider this a "profitable" venture, but it's nice to see that there is at least some initial interest.

I was approached by Packt a little while back to author another book, but based on the amount of time I invested in this one as well as the sales figures I'm sharing here, I don't think it would be a good choice :P

Should I consider writing another book? Any thoughts out there from my fellow denizens of the interwebs?
