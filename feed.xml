Though these specifications exist to facilitate the development of new language drivers or to consistently implement new features across drivers, being aware of them can help when it comes to troubleshooting issues. One of the more prominent specifications is the Server Discovery and... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Blue Force (Tsunami Games) - 1993</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/03/31/blue-force/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Blue Force (Tsunami Games) - 1993" /><published>2022-03-31T06:02:55-04:00</published> <updated>2022-05-12T09:37:51-04:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/03/31/blue-force/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/03/31/blue-force/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="Let's Adventure!" /> <summary> This review is part of the “Let’s Adventure!” series.

Blue Force was also designed by Police Quest designer Jim Walls so there are some thematic similarities between the titles.

Applications can use change streams to subscribe to all data changes on a single collection, a database, or an entire deployment, and immediately react to them. For applications that rely on change streams, ensuring continuity on process restart can be accomplished by specif... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Cleaning Up ETL Results in MongoDB by Transposing Multiple Arrays</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/02/07/cleaning-up-etl-results-in-mongodb-by-transposing-multiple-arrays/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cleaning Up ETL Results in MongoDB by Transposing Multiple Arrays" /><published>2022-02-07T09:05:00-05:00</published> <updated>2022-02-08T08:53:17-05:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/02/07/cleaning-up-etl-results-in-mongodb-by-transposing-multiple-arrays/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/02/07/cleaning-up-etl-results-in-mongodb-by-transposing-multiple-arrays/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="MongoDB" /> <summary> When performing an ETL from a normalized relational dataset there’s a good chance a 1:1 conversion won’t produce the desired results on the first pass. For example, if the goal is to Model One-to-Many Relationships with Embedded Documents but the dataset contains a number of relationships mapped to individual fields as arrays of scalar values, you’ll likely want to convert these to subdocuments... </summary> </entry> </feed>
