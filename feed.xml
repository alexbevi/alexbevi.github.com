<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_with_Rama_(video_game)">Rendezvous with Rama</a> is an interactive fiction game with graphics published by Telarium, a subsidiary of Spinnaker Software, in 1984. It was developed in cooperation with Arthur C. Clarke and based upon his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_with_Rama">1973 science fiction novel Rendezvous with Rama</a>.</p>

<p>After an uncatalogued giant asteroid is discovered approaching Earth, scientists soon realize that it is in reality an alien starship. As commander of the spaceship Endeavor, and being the nearest to the gargantuan ship, it is up to you to rendezvous with it and explore it before it leaves the Solar system.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/rdv/rdv_003.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I was actually really excited to play this game as I was a huge fan of the books in my early teens. The Rama series of books were one of the few full series I actually re-read more than once (along with Ringworld and Dune). Since this was an earlier adventure game I expected the experience to be a lot more akin to an interactive fiction game than an adventure game … which turned out to be a pretty accurate assessment.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/rdv/rdv_004.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You start off in your ship, and the first order of business is to get to the navigation console to maneuver towards the giant ship you’re there to investigate. This is done by choosing a direction (ex: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EAST</code>), which will redraw the screen with an updated description of where you are and some clues as to what you can interact with. Once you get to the navigation console you can either turn on the autopilot, or you can manually try to dock with RAMA. I opted for the autopilot, so I’m not really sure how difficult the manual approach would have been.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/rdv/rdv_007.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once docked, you put on your spacesuit, navigate the airlock and are onboard the ship. From here you start moving around from screen to screen trying to figure out what this ship is and what secrets it holds. Every screen is extremely well described, so it’s pretty obvious <em>what</em> you can interact with … but it’s not always obvious <em>how</em> you’re supposed to describe your interactions.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/rdv/rdv_011.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The latter half of the game requires you to use your simp companion (a monkey named Goldie) to follow instructions to help you solve various puzzles. The instructions need to be incredibly precise or else you’ll just get a generic error. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GOLDIE CLIMB UP</code> won’t work, but adding a comma and issuing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GOLDIE, CLIMB UP</code> will.</p>

<p>I’ll be perfectly honest, I needed to rely pretty heavily on the walkthrough to get through this game as I was not having a great time getting the commands entered in a way that would please the game’s parser.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/rdv/screenshot-2023-August-24-06-35-35.png" alt="" />
<em>Dragonfly sequence from the Apple II release</em></p>

<p>This game was one of the first titles I picked up for this series, but I found myself getting stuck and unable to progress almost a dozen times. I played both the Commodore 64 and Apple II versions at least a handful of times, and each time I’d get to an area of Rama where I’d try to descend into a pit and the game would just freeze.</p>

<p>There’s a sequence where you need to play through an arcade game on your flying craft called the dragonfly. If you fail the minigame you just crash land in the same spot you’d end up in if you won, so I didn’t think much of it. After getting stuck in 2 different versions of the game after crashing I thought maybe you need to win the minigame to progress.</p>

<p>I did this on the Apple II release, won, made my way through Rama to the spot I kept getting stuck at …….. and still got stuck. I don’t know if there’s an issue with the ROMs I found for these systems, but I replayed the first half of this game more times than I’d like to admit.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/rdv/rdv_008.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The DOS release of the game doesn’t include the minigame at all, which is why I ended up playing through that version. It wasn’t for lack of trying with the Commodore 64 or Apple II releases though, as I enjoyed those versions a little better.</p>

<p>When comparing the visuals of the DOS port to the others, the colour palette is just bland. Most screens only have 2 colours and tend to look like baby puke on the screen. The other ports tried a bit harder and blended up to 4 colours per screen, which was noticeably more visually appealing.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/rdv/rdv_017.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You’ve only got a limited amount of time to investigate Rama, as the ship is on a crash-course with the sun. Once you get through the game and return to your ship you discover Rama is actually navigating around the sun to use the gravitational force to slingshot itself out of our solar system.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure this game follows some elements of the book pretty closely, but I don’t remember there being any monkeys you needed to rely on to solve puzzles. It’s been at least 30 years since I last read the book so it’s possible I’m misremembering and the story of the game is even more faithful to the source material than I think it is.</p>

<p>This is a very story heavy game without really much to do. There is some PC speaker style beeps and boops for music and sound effects on certain screens, but nothing outstanding. I can’t hold this against a game from 1984 though, so I applaud the effort.</p>

<p>Having finished the game I’m motivated to revisit the story again - but I think I’ll just <a href="https://www.audible.ca/pd/Rendezvous-with-Rama-Audiobook/B06ZYNRMZW">listen to the audiobook</a> this time around. Though it was nice to spend some time in this world again, I don’t think I’d recommend the game to anyone - but if you’re looking for a good book …</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner_(1997_video_game)">Blade Runner</a> is a point-and-click adventure game developed by Westwood Studios and published by Virgin Interactive for Microsoft Windows, released on November 14, 1997. The game is not a direct adaptation of the 1982 Ridley Scott film Blade Runner but is instead a “sidequel”, telling an original story, which runs parallel to the film’s plot, occasionally intersecting with it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/br/scummvm-bladerunner-win-00001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Set in 2019 Los Angeles, the game tells the story of Ray McCoy, an elite detective charged with hunting down a group of dangerous replicants (bioengineered androids designed to look and act like humans). Although several of the film’s characters appear in the game, with some of the original actors returning to voice them, the film’s protagonist, Rick Deckard, does not appear in a speaking role. Instead, he is referred to on multiple occasions, is seen several times, and his activities as depicted in the film are mentioned. Other parallels with the film include the reproduction of several prominent locations, as well as scenes and dialogue closely modelled on the original. The game also features extracts from the film’s soundtrack.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/br/scummvm-bladerunner-win-00016.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When the game starts you’re investigating an attack at an animal store. Apparently the place has been shot up, but it doesn’t appear to be a robbery so McCoy is tasked with trying to find out who did it an why. This is done by sweeping the cursor over the scene to see when it either turns green (so you can interact with something), or blue (so you can move in that direction).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/br/scummvm-bladerunner-win-00008.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This game has an interesting character interaction mechanic, as you can select a <em>Conversation Choice</em> from you options screen before engaging in a conversation. These choices set the tone for the conversation and depending on what you pick can effect the information you get back. This is what I assumed at least, but I only played around with it at the very beginning of the game, then set it to the question mark and sort of just left it there.</p>

<p>The KIA, which is your personal computer (and where you change options or save/load the game) is also where you can review the evidence you’ve collected during your investigation. This is extremely helpful as you can review conversations you’ve had, as well as see what evidence you’ve picked up or hardcopies you’ve printed while analyzing photos.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/br/scummvm-bladerunner-win-00012.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Remember that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHepKd38pr0">scene in the movie where Deckard is enhancing a photo?</a> You guessed it, that mechanic makes its way into this game, and is actually used a few times to advance the plot. Honestly I remember when I originally played this game I spent a lot of time with each photo you get access to just trying to enhance every possible section to see if it hid more clues.</p>

<p>It’s pretty cool how these 2D photos can be sort of navigated in 3D, as you can uncover details “behind” or “around” certain sections to make details appear such as faces.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/br/scummvm-bladerunner-win-00010.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Not all aspects of the movie translate to “fun” when made into playable elements of the game. The Voight-Kampff test that is used to determine if someone is a replicant or human can be administered to various characters, but I found that it was more tedious than enjoyable. You’re basically just clicking one of three buttons to ask questions of varying degrees of “difficulty” to the subject. You don’t see the subject reacting - just a picture of an eyeball and an arbitrary meter than is supposed to (I think) show “reaction time”.</p>

<p>I sort of just kept mashing the buttons until the game decided on a result and I was allowed to move on.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/br/scummvm-bladerunner-win-00022.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are a handful of characters you can interact with throughout the game, and as you progress you’ll be given certain dialogue options you can use to learn more about your investigation. You can only ask characters about a certain topic once (in most cases), so it’s extra helpful that anything important to the main story is also captured in your KIA as evidence so that you can revisit it later if needed.</p>

<p>This game is fully voiced, and the voice actors are quite good. The background music is also very atmospheric and borrows heavily from the movie. This makes for an extremely immersive experience.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/br/scummvm-bladerunner-win-00006.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Your job as a blade runner is ultimately to “retire” replicants. As such, you’ve got your trusty sidearm with you at all times, which you can whip out pretty much any time and start firing. There’s a firing range at the police station you can visit at any point and run through to get some practice, and you will need to take out a couple characters (and some rats in the sewers), but overall the gun plays a pretty minor role over the course of the game.</p>

<p>There are three different difficulty levels you can play through the game at (Easy, Normal, Hard), and I opted for easy. This gives you unlimited ammo and I’m assuming also makez it easier to kill your targets … and possibly some other things I didn’t notice.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/br/scummvm-bladerunner-win-00002.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Overall I’d say this is a pretty solid, well made game … but the cutscenes are awful. For a game made in 1997 the character models are rigid and lack emotion, the lip syncing is terrible at best and the movements are wooden. It really detracts from an otherwise excellent game as it feels like it was slapped together. Seriously, when you watch the cutscenes it looks like someone made a stop-action video with marionettes.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/br/scummvm-bladerunner-win-00026.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For me, the story is everything in these games … and Blade Runner doesn’t disappoint. Since it’s based in the same “universe” as the original movie you get to enjoy some minor crossovers, but overall it’s a new adventure that leverages the elements of the movie that made it a cult classic. Your humanity is brought into question, you’re framed for a crime and need to clear your name and your decisions throughout the game have consequences.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/br/scummvm-bladerunner-win-00029.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are multiple endings, but I didn’t go back to try any of these out. I do think it’s pretty cool that the game leaves it up to you how you want to finish act 5 and decide “which side you’re on”.</p>

<p>I’ve had this game on my short list for almost a decade because I remember owning this when it came out and never finishing it. I was a huge fan of the movie and had fond memories of the game’s story as well, but never managed to make it more than half way through at the time.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xwnmjq/dedicated-fans-spent-8-years-making-the-1997-blade-runner-game-run-on-a-modern-pc">the reverse engineering began</a> and it looked like this game would be playable in ScummVM I got extremely excited. This game was recently re-released as the “Enhanced Edition”, but apparently that version was so badly done they <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blade-runner-enhanced-edition-unpopular-adds-original-1997-version">re-re-released it with the 1997 version</a>. The ScummVM devs really did some great work bringing this game back for modern systems, and I believe they also added the subtitles to the game.</p>

<p>Cutscene quality aside, I’d recommend this game to any adventure game fan - as long as they’re playing the original release via ScummVM ;)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripper_(video_game)">Ripper</a> is a 1996 interactive movie point-and-click adventure game developed and published by Take-Two Interactive for MS-DOS and Macintosh. The cast includes Christopher Walken, Paul Giamatti, Karen Allen, Burgess Meredith (in his final performance before his death the following year), David Patrick Kelly, Ossie Davis, and John Rhys-Davies. The villain of the game is chosen at random from the four main characters. A limited number of the clues and puzzles, plus a single line of dialogue in the ending, change according to the villain’s identity.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ripper/ripper_005.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is an FMV game, so you start off with an intro movie that sets up the premise for the game. Right away you’re drawn into this world as the credits roll and you realize the cast is a bunch of actual actors - all while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4HA3vUv2c">Blue Öyster Cult’s <em>(Don’t Fear) The Reaper</em></a> plays in the background. This interactive movie is going to play out more like a movie than a game … I can feel it … and I’m fucking excited!</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ripper/ripper_001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once the opening sequence completes you find yourself in a room with Detective Magnotta, played by none other than Christopher Walken. He delivers his lines in a very “Walkenesque” fashion, which just further draws you into the game world right off the hop. As a meta note, Walken and <em>Don’t Fear the Reaper</em> would be reunited a few years later on the SNL skit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_Cowbell">“More Cowbell”</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ripper/ripper_022.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You play the part of a reporter - Jake Quinlan - who is covering the Ripper murders. Apparently the Ripper communicates with you directly for some reason, so you find yourself on at the scene of a murder where you first meet Magnotta. There are a very limited number of things you can do in the game world, so you sweep the mouse over the screen to see if the cursor changes to a different kind of icon.</p>

<p>Basically you can move around, inspect, pick up, use or talk - typical adventure game actions. Unlike most adventure games though, these actions are very intentional on their targets so you can’t pick the wrong one. If you can talk to a character, that will be your only option on that scene.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ripper/ripper_049.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When you have the option to interact with a character this is done with a simple list of topics. As you progress through the game additional topics will become available for various characters depending on other interactions you’ve had with the game world. You’ll need to pay <em>extremely close</em> attention to everything everyone says as most conversations can’t be repeated and it’s easy to miss a clue or a cue that lets you know where to go next.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ripper/ripper_053.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game actually comes with a built in notebook you can use to record clues as you progress. This is an interesting mechanic, but it would be way more useful if it would record the clues for you automatically. Other than near the end of the game, unless you manually enter content into the notebook it will just remain empty.</p>

<p>This seems like a missed opportunity, as this game is very easy to get lost in which will result in a lot of backtracking and questioning everyone repeatedly to see if there are any new conversation topics. This can very quickly become tedious.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ripper/ripper_056.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though the actual gameplay of this “game” can be a bit annoying and repetitive, the acting in the cut scenes and character interactions more than make up for it. The underlying story of the game, including your pursuit of the Ripper and the backstory of the main characters, how they’re connected and how they’re all connected to the ripper murders is fantastic. I found myself rushing through the actual interactive elements of this game just so I could get the story to progress as the story is what really shines through here.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ripper/ripper_055.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Parts of this game take place in cyberspace. Your “data angel” interfaces with a list of virtual icons that lead to “wells”. These wells contain clues, story elements or software. Each well requires a password, which will either be written down somewhere or shared via a conversation. It is <em>so easy</em> to miss these passwords and get stuck, so you’ll likely find yourself referring to a walkthrough in order to progress through this game … I know I did.</p>

<p>Once you finally get into a well, chances are you’ll either be presented with a combat sequence or a puzzle. This is where the game really fell apart for me, because I fucking hated every single one of these sequences.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ripper/ripper_041.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The puzzles are brutally hard. I did not enjoy a single one of these and either looked up the solution or skipped the sequence entirely. I’m pretty sure the developers knew they were artificially padding the game with this bullshit because there’s a cheat code you can use to skip literally every puzzle or combat sequence. I’m just going to list them here (copied from <a href="https://www.cheatbook.de/files/ripper.htm">cheatbook.de</a>) in case you happen to take a run at this game after reading this review and find yourself as frustrated as I was and looking for a quick way to progress:</p>

<pre><code class="language-`">Puzzle in Catherine's Appartment      - PISCES
Catherine's Well                      - ARCADE

Warp Space puzzle                     - warp
Wofforod's Well puzzle                - vulcan
</code></pre>

<p>Just type these passwords in at the beginning of the sequence and you’ll skip it entirely.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ripper/ripper_057.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you investigate you’ll find things you can scan into your WAC, which is a portable computer/phone/database thing. Clues are stored here, and some of them can be interacted with if you find pieces of software to do so. For example, you’ll need to unlock an audio-lock at some point, so you’ll record a conversation with someone then use audio editing software to rearrange the clip into a voice key.</p>

<p>Actually as soon as the game begins Magnotta throws a cup on the ground and breaks it. You need to reassemble this in your WAC (after picking it up) to get a clue that’s written on the cup. This sequence is a pain in the ass, so you basically have 5 minutes of gameplay before the game gets in the way of the story :P</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ripper/ripper_042.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Occasionally the game will alert you that you have an incoming WAC transmission. These are used to progress the story once you’ve exhausted the various conversation topics and have analyzed and picked up everything in all available locations. When I first started playing the game I had nothing but problems with the WAC as the videos didn’t render properly. It turns out this is a problem with the game itself; not DOSBox. You need to ensure you’ve patched the game to at least <a href="https://archive.org/details/ripperpatch">version 1.05</a> as this addresses a number of video issues, so make sure you do this before you start playing.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ripper/ripper_054.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The CG in this game is sort of what you’d expect for this time period … not great. All video is also super heavily compressed so there are artifacts galore, and a low framerate as well. I honestly didn’t find it detracted too much from the experience though as the acting more than made up for the visual quality.</p>

<p>My main gripe though, was that I found myself constantly switching CDs. Yeah I know this is an old game, and FMV games typically were multi-disc, but when playing in 2023 this is frustrating enough to be worth mentioning. There are 6 discs to this game, so you’ll be prompted to switch discs pretty often.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ripper/ripper_060.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It takes a lot of slogging, but you’ll eventually find your way to virtual White Chapel where you confront the ripper … after solving one more meaningless puzzle. So many puzzles …</p>

<p>This game would have made a good movie. As a game it sort of sucks. The puzzles are brutally hard, the actual interactive elements are sort of boring and navigating between scenes is painfully slowly and purposely drawn out. I would highly recommend reading the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ripper/">Wired article</a> about the game’s development and maybe just watching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWpWokMLyRs">longplay on YouTube</a> if you’re looking to experience <em>Ripper</em>.</p>

<p>I had extremely high hopes for this game given the A-list cast, an extremely interesting premise and story line and elements of cyberpunk, but the game fell flat. I wouldn’t recommend playing this, though it might be worth checking out clips just to experience some of the performances the actors give.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Picking up immediately where <a href="/blog/2023/02/18/manhunter-new-york/">Manhunter: New York</a> left off, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhunter_2:_San_Francisco">Manhunter 2: San Francisco</a> has the player crash-landing their stolen ship in the City by the Bay after trying unsuccessfully to keep up with enigmatic serial killer Phil. Left with no alternatives, the player assumes the identity of a local Manhunter and solves more crimes for the alien Orbs while searching for Phil and working for the local human resistance.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mh2/scummvm-mh2-00002.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After crash landing and killing another manhunter, your first course of action is to pick up the “Manhunter Assignment Device” (MAD) that has been conveniently dropped in plain sight (as opposed to having also been crushed by the spaceship you just crash landed). Just like the first game, the MAD is used each day to give you an outline of the movement of your targets.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mh2/scummvm-mh2-00003.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If there are multiple targets on the screen you can select them individually and trace their movements to identify additional locations within the city to investigate. Additional locations are unlocked via the MAD as you (correctly) identify suspects by searching for their names. The formula is pretty straightforward in most cases as you’ll be given a partial name (usually the first name and an initial), and later on some clue will give you the last name to fill in the blank.\</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mh2/scummvm-mh2-00020.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If after identifying someone in the MAD they have an address listed, this will be a new location you can travel to.</p>

<p>The travel mechanic in this game also mirrors that of the first game in that you get a map of San Francisco broken up into various areas with certain locations accessible for selection. Selecting any of these allows your manhunter to travel to this location to investigate, and as each day progresses new locations will be added. Since you have to backtrack occasionally, all locations remain available throughout the game once they’ve been discovered.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mh2/scummvm-mh2-00012.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game is split up into 3 days, which each require you to visit every possible area, interact with every character, pick up every piece of “evidence” possible and discover every possible suspect. Once you’ve done this you’ll get an “ORB override” on your MAD where you’ll be prompted to identify the suspects you were tracking via the MAD during that day.</p>

<p>This … can be frustrating, as if you’ve missed <em>anything</em>, the ORB override will never come and you’ll just find yourself endlessly backtracking to try and find what you may have missed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mh2/scummvm-mh2-00008.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Progress through each location is done by either investigating a static scene, or by playing through an arcade sequence (a minigame). These games can be extremely challenging, so thankfully Sierra gives you a difficulty toggle. I would highly recommend trying these at the “Normal” and “Difficult” settings first just to challenge yourself, then when you invariably fail and want to throw this game out the window, drop it down to “Easy”.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mh2/scummvm-mh2-00010.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When investigating a scene it’s pretty straightforward to identify the areas you can interact with, so you basically just need to move your cursor around until it turns into a “hand” or a “magnifying glass”. If you have the option to pick something up, do it as you’ll either need it for the day to end, or you may need it for an item combination puzzle that will make no sense.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mh2/scummvm-mh2-00027.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>At any point in the game you can view your inventory by pressing TAB. If you select any of the items in your inventory you can inspect that entry for more information … or if you happen to be on a specific scene, selecting an inventory item may use that item. This is not obvious, and can lead to a lot of frustration if you’re not trying to use every inventory item on every screen “just in case”.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mh2/scummvm-mh2-00024.png" alt="" />
<em>Use the flask here to pour the urine sample into it … you know … for reasons</em></p>

<p>For example, when you get to the doctor’s house on Day 2 and find the urine sample, instead of being able to just pick it up you’ll actually need to pour it into a flask. On this screen when you hover over the vial it just gives you an informational prompt that it’s a “urine sample”, so it’s really not obvious that you can interact with it. It’s also not obvious that you <em>should</em> put anything in the flask you got on Day 1 … so this puzzle is a huge pain in the ass.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mh2/scummvm-mh2-00026.png" alt="" />
<em>God I hated this sequence</em></p>

<p>Actually, “pain in the ass” is a good summary of this game. None of the arcade sequences are fun. The best description I can give is that they’re just tedious, and though the game is nice enough to let you restart if you die - you have to restart from the very beginning of the sequence. Some of these sequences are mazes which require a ridiculous degree of accuracy to navigate, so <em>MAKE SURE YOU SAVE OFTEN</em> … as you WILL die often.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mh2/scummvm-mh2-00025.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The art style is quite good, and you wouldn’t even know this is an AGI game. To be fair it was the last AGI title released, so the developers knew how to squeeze every bit of quality out of the engine at this point, but the engine is still dated for a title released in 1989. The sound effects are pretty basic, and though there is music on occasion, it’s PC speaker music so there’s not a lot of depth or variety.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mh2/scummvm-mh2-00034.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In the final section of the game you’re treated to a combination of a minigame + a maze. I continue to hate mazes in games, especially when you couple a maze with “touching the walls causes instant death”. This section is even worse than the awful <a href="https://screenrant.com/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-dam-level-co-creator/">underwater level in the NES version of TMNT</a>. Thankfully you can save your game at any point, so you’ll likely be saving 4-5 times per screen here as you very, very slowly progress through the maze.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mh2/scummvm-mh2-00035.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are A LOT of things I really enjoyed about Manhunter when I played the original. Those elements definitely carried over to the sequel, but the sum of those parts didn’t really translate to an enjoyable experience. The story was pretty weak, and though you get a bit more backstory as to the ORBs, the whole thing with Phil and “the viewer” and him become the leader of the rat people is just weird and slapped together.</p>

<p>Progress through the game isn’t smooth and it’s easy to get stuck. Death waits for you around literally every corner, and though the “Game Over” screens tend to be funny and allow you to resume right before you screwed up, they occur far too frequently.</p>

<p>I’d love to play another game that uses some of these gameplay elements, but updated with some quality of life improvements and a better story to tie them all together.</p>

<p>I also don’t think I’d recommend this title to anyone at this point and likely won’t be returning to it again. If you want to check this out, maybe pick <a href="/blog/2023/02/18/manhunter-new-york/">Manhunter: New York</a> up instead as it was a bit tighter of a game.</p>

  <p>Cross posted from the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/improving-nodejs-drivers-scram-sha-256-support">MongoDB Blog</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>MongoDB always strives to offer best-in-class features, functionality, and security. A number of <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/authentication/#authentication-mechanisms">authentication mechanisms</a> currently exist to verify the identity of a connecting client to your cluster, and when using the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/security-scram/">Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM</code>)</a> there are two possible hashing functions: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-256</code>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/auth/auth.rst#defaults">MongoDB Driver Authentication Specification</a> outlines that when attempting to authenticate using SCRAM:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-256</code> is present in the list of mechanism, then it MUST be used as the default; otherwise, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-1</code> MUST be used as the default […]”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A MongoDB Server (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongos</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongod</code>) can be configured with a list of possible <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/parameters/#mongodb-parameter-param.authenticationMechanisms"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">authenticationMechanisms</code></a>. As a result, MongoDB can be configured to return new authentication mechanisms which can upgrade already running applications to more secure authentication. This is the case when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-256</code> is added to a cluster that previously only supported <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-1</code>.</p>

<p>Prior to hashing passwords with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SHA-256</code>, they will first be <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5802">prepared using SASLprep</a>. The MongoDB Node.js driver leverages an external library (<a href="https://github.com/reklatsmasters/saslprep"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">saslprep</code></a>) for this functionality, which was an <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#optionaldependencies">optional dependency</a> and only used if available. Though a number of checks were in place to ensure the library was available (and loaded), an <a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-5289">edge case was found</a> where these checks could fail and report availability incorrectly.</p>

<h2 id="potential-issue">Potential Issue</h2>

<p>Most applications won’t experience this issue, however if your Node.js project is being bundled using an alternate bundler (such as <a href="https://webpack.js.org/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">webpack</code></a>) it’s possible a variation of this issue may surface.</p>

<p>If your application was affected, it would be unable to connect to your MongoDB cluster. The stack trace from the error that would be thrown should include a call to <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/51a573fe99506b81c"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">continueScramConversation</code></a> similar to the following examples:</p>

    at continueScramConversation (/app/webpack:[...]/mongodb/lib/core/auth/scram.js:xxx:yy)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that <a href="https://mongoosejs.com/">Mongoose</a> applications can also be affected, as Mongoose wraps the Node.js driver:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>TypeError: (0 , o.saslprep) is not a function
    at continueScramConversation (/app/webpack:[...]/mongoose/node_modules/mongodb/lib/cmap/auth/scram.js:xxx:yy)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>The underlying issue was addressed in versions <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v5.7.0">5.7.0</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v4.17.0">4.17.0</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v3.7.4">3.7.4</a> of the MongoDB Node.js driver, so depending on the version of the driver being used by your application a minor version update will address this.</p>

<p>Upgrading your application’s libraries and deploying to production may not always be possible in a timely fashion. If this is the case and you happen to hit the issue described above a workaround would be to append the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#mongodb-urioption-urioption.authMechanism"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">authMechanism</code> option</a> to your connection string with a value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-1</code> as follows:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>mongodb+srv://xyz.mongodb.net/test?authMechanism=SCRAM-SHA-1
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will force the driver to attempt authorization using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-1</code> hashing algorithm. Note that connection string changes would still require the application to be restarted for those changes to take effect.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="MongoDB" /><category term="mongodb" /><category term="drivers" /><category term="nodejs" /><category term="typescript" /><category term="javascript" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cross posted from the MongoDB Blog]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.alexbevi.com/images/mongodb-logo.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.alexbevi.com/images/mongodb-logo.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Uninvited (ICOM Simulations) - 1986</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2023/08/09/uninvited/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Uninvited (ICOM Simulations) - 1986" /><published>2023-08-09T07:15:38-04:00</published><updated>2023-08-14T21:08:50-04:00</updated><id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2023/08/09/uninvited</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2023/08/09/uninvited/"><![CDATA[<blockquote class="prompt-info">

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninvited_(video_game)">Uninvited</a> is a black-and-white horror-themed point-and-click adventure game. It was originally developed for the Macintosh by ICOM Simulations released in 1986 by Mindscape as part of the MacVenture series.</p>

<p>The following year, a color version of the game was released for the Amiga and Atari ST, and in 1991 for the Nintendo Entertainment System, which is the version I played for this review.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/uninvited/Uninvited 2023-08-09 06.23.04.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I’ve now played basically all the MacVentures titles for the NES because those are the versions that I personally grew up with. I really enjoy these menu-driven, story heavy adventure games that are essentially just visual novels. Though I didn’t really love <a href="/blog/2023/04/11/deja-vu/">Déjà Vu</a>, <a href="/blog/2021/08/16/shadowgate/">Shadowgate</a> remains one of my favourite game to this day.</p>

<p>As with those titles, the game screen is divided between 3 main areas: the stage (where you can see the current room), your inventory then your verb list/navigation helper. Since this is a Nintendo game you navigate the interface with the D-pad, but for the other ports you would be able to do this using a mouse.</p>

<em>Screenshot lovingly borrowed from <a href="http://www.honestgamers.com/6774/amiga/uninvited/review.html">Honest Gamers’ review</a> of the Amiga port of Uninvited</em></p>

<p>Since I’m starting to get to that point in my review journey where I may not have an opportunity to play any games for certain systems, I <em>really</em> wanted to be able to play through this game on an Amiga emulator as I haven’t tackled that system yet. I tried … really I did! I got <a href="https://fs-uae.net/">FS-UAE</a> setup, but couldn’t get anything to run properly (even with the proper Kickstart ROM). I tried <a href="https://dirkwhoffmann.github.io/vAmiga/">vAmiga</a> as it looked extremely promising, but still nothing wants to work for me.</p>

<p>I snagged a screenshot from another site just to show the difference between the interfaces. I plan on completing one game for this series on the Amiga if it kills me … but Uninvited won’t be it.</p>

<p>You find yourself crashed in front of a mansion. Your sister is missing, so chances are she’s inside. In you go to try and find her only to discover the house is full of ghosts and demos and a shitload of items you can pick up. As you progress you discover the house once belonged to a sorcerer with a number of apprentices. Dracan, the most talented apprentice, became corrupt and killed the other inhabitants with his magic, resulting in the house becoming haunted.</p>

<p>None of this really explains why your sister is being held captive, but whatever … ghosts and stuff.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/uninvited/Uninvited 2023-08-09 06.47.12.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Your goal is to survive long enough to find your sister. This will involve examining everything, picking up everything and trying to use everything on everything in every room and on every creature you encounter. You know might call this “playing an adventure game” … and you’d be right.</p>

<p>There are SO many things you can pick up in this game, and the vast majority of them are red herrings. Don’t forget to try and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OPEN</code> everything you pick up as well as they may contain OTHER items you can interact with. Some items (scrolls mostly) contain spells you can learn. Like Shadowgate, you’ll need to use these spells to help solve specific puzzles.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/uninvited/Uninvited 2023-08-09 06.17.16.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Most creatures you can interact with will kill you if you approach the interaction incorrectly. See that ghost lady over there? Just because you happen to have a bottle of “No Ghost” with you, remember to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OPEN</code> it first before trying to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">USE</code> it on her or that’ll be the end of you.</p>

<p>This game feels a lot bigger than Shadowgate and seems to have a lot more to do. There’s even a maze you’ll need to navigate in order to get a key item. I really dislike mazes in most games, but in this case it wasn’t overly difficult - just a bit tedious. Make sure you didn’t forget to take the pendent out of the mailbox when you first started the game … you’ll need it in the maze to scare off zombies. Oh, you forgot to pick it up …. whelp …. sucks to be you!</p>

<p>I didn’t realize I could use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TELEMAZE</code> spell to quickly exit the maze once I was done. I know in retrospect it’s pretty obvious that’s what the spell was for but I completely forgot about it …</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/uninvited/Uninvited 2023-08-09 07.00.41.png" alt="" />
<em>I’m pretty sure that’s actually the combination you need … you’re welcome</em></p>

<p>The majority of the puzzles aren’t difficult, but finding the items you need to solve a specific puzzle can be tricky. Finding the combination to the safe requires you to find a list of chemicals then find their values on the periodic table. If you know this is what you’re supposed to do it’s not too hard either, but I missed the note that had that clue on it so I resorted to a walkthrough to get past this section.</p>

<em>Domestic violence was apparently acceptable to Nintendo’s censors</em></p>

<p>Eventually you find your way through the mansion, find your sister, throw a goblet at the demon that was possessing her, climb out the window and win the game. Overall it’s not a bad game, though the story is pretty weak.</p>

<p>The Nintendo port of the game once again comes with a descent soundtrack (check out the track called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPu270Eoedc&amp;list=PL25CE9EE664153901&amp;index=2">“Daylight”</a> for a taste), which makes the experience of navigating the mansion a bit more enjoyable. I don’t believe the other ports have background music, so this is definitely a quality of life improvement.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/uninvited/Uninvited 2023-08-09 07.13.33.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Personally I’ve played through all these ICOM Simulations games for the Nintendo countless times as they were favourites of mine when I was a kid. I don’t have rose-coloured glasses on when it comes to the overall quality of these titles. Honestly, Uninvited is pretty derivative of Shadowgate and doesn’t really add anything new to the mix - other than the keys open multiple doors in this game (instead of it being one key per door).</p>

<p>For fans of this very specific type of menu driven adventure game I might recommend giving Uninvited a shot. If you have a hankering for this type of gameplay experience I’d recommend going back to Shadowgate instead.</p>

<p>One exciting change that is coming in release 6.0.0 of the Node.js Driver is that the modified (or original) document targeted by a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">findOneAnd*</code> operation will now be returned by default.</p>

<h2 id="current-state">Current State</h2>

<p>Up until now, as opposed to returning the requested document, this family of API methods would return a <a href="https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/5.7/interfaces/ModifyResult.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ModifyResult</code></a>, which would contain the requested document in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value</code> field. This design was due to these APIs leveraging the MongoDB Server’s <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/findAndModify/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">findOneAndModify</code></a> command and wrapping the command’s <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/findAndModify/#output">output</a> directly.</p>

<p>To demonstrate, let’s adapt the code from the Driver’s documented <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/usage-examples/">usage examples</a> to update one document in our <em>movies</em> collection using the <a href="https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/5.7/classes/Collection.html#findOneAndUpdate"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">findOneAndUpdate</code></a> API.</p>

<p>One of the options we set was a <a href="https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/5.7/interfaces/FindOneAndUpdateOptions.html#returnDocument"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">returnDocument</code></a> of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">after</code>, which should return the updated document. Though the expectation may be that the function call would return the document directly, instead you would get the output above.</p>

<p>While the document you’re looking for can be accessed using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">updatedMovie.value</code>, that isn’t the most intuitive experience. But changes are on the way!</p>

<h2 id="what-can-we-do-right-now">What can we do right now?</h2>

<p>Starting with the <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v5.7.0">Node.js Driver 5.7.0</a> release, a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FindOneAnd*Options</code> property called <a href="https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/5.7/interfaces/FindOneAndUpdateOptions.html#includeResultMetadata"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">includeResultMetadata</code></a> has been introduced.

<h2 id="what-about-typescript">What about TypeScript?</h2>

<p>If your application uses TypeScript and the MongoDB Node.js Driver, anywhere a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">findOneAnd*</code> call is made, if the requested document is required it will be accessed via the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value</code> property of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ModifyResult</code>. This occurs when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">includeResultMetadata</code> is not set or when it is set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> (the current default value).</p>

<p><img src="/images/product1605-02.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Type hinting will indicate the Schema associated with the collection that the operation was executed against. As we would expect, when the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">includeResultMetadata</code> is changed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code>, inline validation will indicate there’s an issue since the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value</code> property no longer exists on the type associated with the result</p>

<p><img src="/images/product1605-01.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Attempting to compile our TypeScript project will also fail.</p>

<p>If you’re using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">findOneAnd*</code> family of APIs in your JavaScript or TypeScript project, upgrading the MongoDB Node.js Driver to 5.7.0+ and adding the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">includeResultMetadata: false</code> option to those API calls will allow you to adapt your application to the new behavior prior to the 6.0.0 release.</p>

<p>Once 6.0.0 is released, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">includeResultMetadata: false</code> will become the default behavior.

<p>A dastardly alien is stealing all of the children’s Halloween candy! Tony Tough P.I. will not stand for this. He sets out to stop the fiend before it’s too late, and the alien takes over the world! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Tough_and_the_Night_of_Roasted_Moths">Tony Tough and the Night of Roasted Moths</a> is a traditional 2D “point and click” adventure with a crazy story. The humor and style are reminiscent of old LucasArts games, like Day of the Tentacle.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/tony/scummvm-tony-00020.png" alt="" />
<em>That’s probably not racist … right?</em></p>

<p>For a game that was developed originally by an Italian team (and likely written in Italian then localized), it is extremely clever, nuanced and funny. I have had this title on my radar for over a decade - basically since it was added to <a href="https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Tony_Tough_and_the_Night_of_Roasted_Moths">ScummVM in 1.6.0</a>. At that time one of the original developers <a href="/blog/2012/11/02/developer-braindump-tony-tough-and-the-night-of-the-roasted-moths/">provided a braindump</a> of their memories of making the game, which I found informative and fascinating.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/tony/scummvm-tony-00000.png" alt="" />
<em>I’m guessing this will affect the puzzles (like in Curse of Monkey Island)</em></p>

<p>It’s clear the developers took a lot of inspiration from LucasArts as this game unfolds, plays and reads like a Monkey Island, Full Throttle or Sam and Max title. Interactions with the world and other characters is done with a single click that spawns a pictograph that you use to select an action (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TALK</code>,<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">USE</code>,<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TAKE</code>,<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code>, etc), and literally everything you can interact with rewards you with a smart ass response.</p>

<p>The plot is kind of thin as you start off learning that halloween candy is being stolen - and since you’re a private eye (for some reason) you decide to investigate. As soon as you start off your pet Tapir (I thought it was a dog) is kidnapped and you’re left with a ransom note. From here you start working your way through the first of 3 “levels” in this game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/tony/scummvm-tony-00005.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Getting out of the first level introduces you to your first of many, Many, MANY fetch quests and item combination puzzles. In order to get access to the second “level” you need to get past the old lady at the entrance by … dressing like a girl. This requires a smock, a scarf, a wig, a flower and a bag of candy. Sounds a bit convoluted right … like you’re making a sasquatch costume in <a href="/blog/2023/01/23/sam-and-max-hit-the-road/">Sam and Max</a>?</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/tony/scummvm-tony-00015.png" alt="" />
<em>You’ll be SO happy you have this map … trust me!</em></p>

<p>Once you reach the amusement part (second level) Tony will begin to draw a map as you explore. This can be used to fast travel around, which is a huge time saver. Since this game is just a massive series of fetch quests that involve endless backtracking, quality of life improvements like this map are greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/tony/scummvm-tony-00021.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Getting out of the second level requires you to retrieve all the ingredients the fortune teller needs to concoct something that will help him see where you need to go next. This involves fetching those ingredients, but each ingredient is a combination of items you find throughout the park - so it’s a fetch quest within a fetch quest: FETCHQUESTCEPTION!!!!</p>

<p>Though it may be a bit tedious, figuring out what all the items you need are isn’t overly complicated as you can ask any number of NPCs throughout the park about pretty much anything - and the clues they give you (though cryptic at times) tend to point you in the right direction. Personally I found this to be a sign of excellent planning by the developers as they clearly wanted this to be challenging, but approachable (and winnable).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/tony/scummvm-tony-00016.png" alt="" />
<em>Talk to EVERYONE about EVERYTHING!</em></p>

<p>Conversations are basic dialog trees, so nothing groundbreaking here. You’ll need to backtrack a lot as you proceed since new dialog options will appear for most NPCs as task are completed or new areas are unlocked. Pretty much every interaction you have with anyone (or anything) has Tony dropping some witty quip or sarcastic remark, so though it may be a bit tedious it’s at least entertaining.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/tony/scummvm-tony-00006.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The LucasArts influence persists throughout this game, right down to the interaction menu being cribbed from games like <a href="/blog/2023/03/10/full-throttle/">Full Throttle</a>. It’s a good design choice and works well for the game, but for a game this late in our journey it comes across as derivative.</p>

<p>It’s hard to fault Tony Tough for feeling like a LucasArts knock-off as it’s done extremely well and really plays more as an ode to the adventure games that clearly inspired it than as a knock-off.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/tony/scummvm-tony-00032.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Tony Tough and the Night of Roasted Moths</em> is a lot of fun to play mainly due to the dry comedic style of writing that permeates all character interactions and Tony’s observations. The game is visually appealing, and clearly took a page out of the LucasArts book of point-and-click adventure game design.</p>

<p>There was a sequel (<a href="https://www.tony-tough.com/en/tony-tough-a-rakes-progress">Tony Tough™ in A Rake’s Progress</a>) which I won’t be covering during this series but am definitely curious to try out one day. The developers are also working on <a href="https://www.tony-tough.com/en/tony-tough-and-the-army-of-dorkiness">The Army Of Dorkiness Project</a> which is meant to bring Tony Tough back for a third time.</p>

<p>I would recommend this title to anyone looking for a game similar to the later LucasArts adventure games.</p>

For example, MongoDB Atlas - depending on the selected tier - will impose a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/atlas-limits/#connection-limits-and-cluster-tier">connection limit</a>.</p>

<p>Depending on the architecture of your application and how you’ve configured your <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/connection-pool-overview/">connection pools</a> it’s possible you’ve approached or exceeded these limits before and weren’t really sure why. Thankfully MongoDB Atlas provides a number of configurable alerts (such as <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/alert-conditions/#mongodb-alert-Connections---of-configured-limit-is"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Connections % of configured limit</code></a>) which can notify you if you’re approaching a limit, but where are these connections coming from in the first place?</p>

<h2 id="mongodb-drivers">MongoDB Drivers</h2>

<p>Your application has been built using one of <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/">MongoDB’s Drivers</a>, which are all built according to a number of <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications">published specifications</a>. Most noteworthy when it comes to how many connections an application may establish to a MongoDB cluster are the <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-monitoring.rst">Server Monitoring</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/connection-monitoring-and-pooling/connection-monitoring-and-pooling.rst">Connection Monitoring and Pooling</a> (CMAP) specifications.</p>

<p>These specifications help us understand how many connections may be opened, and what variables we should be aware of that can affect these connections such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is the MongoClient single-threaded or multi-threaded</li>
  <li>The MongoDB Server version (&gt;= 4.4)</li>
  <li>The MongoDB Driver version (does it support MongoDB Server 4.4+)</li>
</ul>

<p>Just a quick note regarding <em>Connection Pools</em>: the default value of <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/connection-monitoring-and-pooling/connection-monitoring-and-pooling.rst#id1"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minPoolSize</code></a> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>, which means that using the defaults when a <em>Connection Pool</em> is created it will not contain any connections. For the purposes of this article I imply that at least one connection has been created in the pool and ready for use.</p>

<h3 id="single-threaded-mongoclient">Single-Threaded <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MongoClient</code></h3>

<p>The MongoDB <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/c/">C Driver</a> and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/php/">PHP Driver</a> provide single-threaded <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MongoClient</code> implementations. As such, they do not offer connection pools at all which makes understanding how many connections can be established straightforward<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/mongo-conns-01.png" alt="" />
<em>Connections from a Single Threaded <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MongoClient</code></em></p>

<p>With this configuration, a single connection (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">c1</code>) will be established to each <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/replica-set-members/">replica set member</a>, or if the cluster is <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/sharding/">Sharded</a> each <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/sharded-cluster-query-router/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongos</code></a> present in the seed list when the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MongoClient</code> was created<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. This single connection will be used for data operations as well as to perform <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-monitoring.rst#single-threaded-monitoring">server monitoring</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="prompt-tip">
  <p>Note that when connecting to a Sharded Cluster using a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#dns-seed-list-connection-format">DNS Seed List</a> connection string, the <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/initial-dns-seedlist-discovery/initial-dns-seedlist-discovery.rst#srvmaxhosts"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">srvMaxHosts</code></a> URI option can be configured to limit the number of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongos</code>’ that will be connected to.</p>

<blockquote class="prompt-info">
  <p>Assuming a cluster with 3 nodes, each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MongoClient</code> instance would create 3 connections.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="mongodb-server-42-and-earlier-polling-monitoring">MongoDB Server 4.2 and earlier (Polling Monitoring)</h3>

<p>Prior to MongoDB 4.4, MongoDB Drivers would use a <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-monitoring.rst#polling-protocol">polling protocol to perform server monitoring</a>. This process would involve opening a dedicated <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-monitoring.rst#monitor-thread">monitor thread</a> per host, which would be polled (by default<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>) every 10 seconds (multi-threaded) or 60 seconds (single-threaded) to determine if the state of the host or cluster topology had changed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/mongo-conns-02.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This dedicated monitor thread (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m1</code>) as well as a the 1 or more connections in the connection pool (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">p1</code>) result in at least 2 connections per host. Note that if <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#mongodb-urioption-urioption.minPoolSize"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minPoolSize</code></a> (default: 0) is &gt; 1 this number of connections will <em>always</em> remain open against each host a connection pool has been created for.</p>

<blockquote class="prompt-info">
  <p>Assuming a cluster with 3 nodes, each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MongoClient</code> instance would create 6 connections.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="prompt-tip">
  <p>If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minPoolSize=5</code> then each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MongoClient</code> would create 18 connections (using the formula <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(minPoolSize + 1) x nodes</code>)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="mongodb-server-44-and-later-streaming-monitoring">MongoDB Server 4.4 and later (Streaming Monitoring)</h3>

<p>Starting with MongoDB 4.4, MongoDB Drivers would begin using a <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-monitoring.rst#streaming-protocol">streaming protocol to perform server monitoring</a> - assuming those Drivers were compatible with MongoDB 4.4. The goal of this new protocol was to ensure connected applications could discover topology changes in as close to realtime as possible.</p>

<p>As the polling protocol only polled at fixed intervals, it was possible for topology changes to go undiscovered for upwards of 10 seconds. The streaming protocol would “push” updates from the server to the clients, as opposed to the previous “pull” model, which allowed applications to update their view of the cluster far more quickly.</p>

<p><img src="/images/mongo-conns-03.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Similar to the polling protocol, a dedicated monitor thread (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m1</code>) will be opened per host, as well as 1 or more connections in the connection pool (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">p1</code>). Further to these connections though a third connection (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">r1</code>) is opened per node for <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-monitoring.rst#measuring-rtt">measuring RTT</a> (round trip time). This is needed as the monitor thread is open and listening once established, and will only receive updates from the server as they occur. Measuring RTT require the measurement of the time taken for an operation to travel from the client to the server and back, which the streaming monitor no longer provides.</p>

<blockquote class="prompt-info">
  <p>Assuming a cluster with 3 nodes, each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MongoClient</code> instance would create 9 connections.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="prompt-tip">
  <p>If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minPoolSize=5</code> then each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MongoClient</code> would create 21 connections (using the formula <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(minPoolSize + 2) x nodes</code>)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="what-if-im-using-aws-lambda">What if I’m using AWS Lambda?</h2>

<p>Depending on your application’s architecture, it’s possible to blow past your connection limits pretty quickly. This is one reason why the documented guidance for <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/manage-connections-aws-lambda/">managing connections with AWS Lambda</a> has the first bullet point of <em>“Define the client to the MongoDB server outside the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-prog-model-handler.html">AWS Lambda handler function</a>“</em>.</p>

<p>If each Lambda function were to connect to a MongoDB 4.4+ cluster using a connection string of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongodb+srv://xxx.mongodb.net/?minPoolSize=5</code> and the cluster only had 3000 connections configured, within 150 near-concurrent function executions the cluster could potentially reach the connection limit! This is obviously an extreme scenario, but is meant to help illustrate the impact creating many <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MongoClient</code> instances can potentially have on your cluster.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snatcher_(video_game)">Snatcher</a> is a cyberpunk graphic adventure game developed and published by Konami. It was written and designed by Hideo Kojima and first released in 1988 for the PC-8801 and MSX2 in Japan. Snatcher is set in a future East Asian metropolis where humanoid robots dubbed “Snatchers” have been discovered killing humans and replacing them in society.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/snatcher/Snatcher 2023-06-21 06.35.37.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game follows Gillian Seed, an amnesiac who joins an anti-Snatcher agency in search of his past. Gameplay takes place primarily through a menu-based interface through which the player can choose to examine items, search rooms, speak to characters, explore a semi-open world, and perform other actions.</p>

<p>Part of the fun for me in playing these games is getting to mess around with new emulators. I’m using an old MacBook Pro to play most of these games, so I figured I’d give <a href="http://openemu.org/">OpenEmu</a> a try since I have a couple Sega CD games on my list and this emulator is only available for OSX.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/snatcher/iScreen Shoter - OpenEmu - 230628053228.png" alt="" />
<em>OMG! Play time recording!!!</em></p>

<p>Typically I’d play console games on Android using <a href="https://www.explusalpha.com/">Ex Plus Alpha</a> (which I did for <a href="/blog/2021/08/16/shadowgate/">Shadowgate</a>). I’ve bought all the emulators (NES.emu, SNES.emu, etc) and have been using them for years, but one features I’ve really wanted was the ability to record playtime. I went so far as to open <a href="https://github.com/Rakashazi/emu-ex-plus-alpha/issues/37">an issue in GitHub</a> for it in 2015, but this never got any traction.</p>

<p>OpenEmu appears to support this out of the box, which was a very pleasant surprise. Furthermore you can easily remap the keys for quick save/load, fast forward, rewind and taking a screenshot which I found extremely convenient. I will most likely be using OpenEmu for any future games that it supports as I find the interface and experience a lot better than other multi-emulator systems (such as <a href="https://www.retroarch.com/">RetroArch</a>).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/snatcher/Snatcher 2023-06-21 11.32.37.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Similar to ICOM Simulations type games, Snatcher is predominantly a visual novel. You’re presented with a number of actions you can perform on each static screen that allow you to learn more about your surroundings or interact with a character. You’ll find yourself having to go through the motions of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code>ing at everything available, then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INVESTIGATE</code>-ing everything you just looked at, then repeating because you may have uncovered new options to perform these 2 actions on.</p>

<p>It felt a little redundant initially, then as the game dragged on it actually detracted from the experience. I understand the intent of the selected verbs and how they’re supposed to differ, but from a game design perspective it’s not really adding anything meaningful.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/snatcher/Snatcher 2023-06-26 11.42.16.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The version of the game I played had most character interactions fully voice acted. You’d be presented with a view of the scene that took up about 70% of the screen, with the lower third split into three square where character portraits could be displayed. These portraits would be slightly animated as the characters were speaking so you’d know who was talking, and honestly the voice acting for every character was pretty good.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/snatcher/Snatcher 2023-06-21 11.33.31.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This game is for a mature audience, as there are multiple scenes that some players might find a bit more gory than they might like. As the story unfolds, you’re investigating the murder of one of your fellow Junkers. In this world, the Junkers are sort of like “blade runners” that are tasked with hunting down Snatchers (which if you’re familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner">Blade Runner</a> are just replicants).</p>

<p>You progress the story by traveling from location to location, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MOVE</code>-ing about and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code>ing/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INVESTIGATE</code>-ing everything. Depending on where you are and what you’ve just interacted with, you may uncover some evidence. When this happens, you’ll call it out with a closeup of the item in question which will then be added to your inventory.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/snatcher/Snatcher 2023-06-21 19.21.48.png" alt="" />
<em>Whatever this is I should probably hold onto it</em></p>

<p>Gillian acquires a limited number of inventory items throughout the game that can be used during character interactions (ex: money, Junker ID) but most of the items you find throughout the game are considered evidence. Both evidence and items can be used on characters you’re talking to, and you’ll likely find yourself trying literally everything on everyone to see what will work.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/snatcher/Snatcher 2023-06-26 11.56.45.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Throughout the game you’re accompanied by a robot companion named “Metal Gear”. By interacting with him you’re able to save your game, make video phone calls and perform certain environment interactions (like scanning for SNOW-9, scanning for movement or if it’s dark turning on a light). Metal Gear will also nudge you along with some hints as to where you should go next or what you might want to try on a certain screen.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/snatcher/Snatcher 2023-06-23 06.20.06.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Aside from the usual “go from screen to screen mashing through all menu options”, there are a handful of puzzles you’ll need to complete. At one point you need to create a reconstruction of a suspect based on the descriptions provided by someone you interview. This is … painful. Technically you could just keep trying all possible combinations until you get it right but that will take <em>forever</em>! This was very much a section I relied on the walkthrough for.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/snatcher/Snatcher 2023-06-21 19.11.02.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Unlike visual novel style games, Snatcher also includes arcade sequences. These areas involve having to move the cursor around the screen and shooting robots before they shoot back. Honestly they’re not too challenging, and if you happen to die the game lets you resume at the screen before the sequence began. This is beneficial as I forgot to save for a while when I got to this first section and got myself killed pretty quickly :P</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/snatcher/Snatcher 2023-06-23 05.17.26.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The content of this game is much more mature, and Gillian has conversation options to basically hit on every woman you meet. Apparently the Sega CD release censors some of the graphics and removes some of these options, but there’s enough in there to give you a good idea as to what kind of a guy the main character is.</p>

<p>A lot of these conversation options are hidden until you <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INVESTIGATE</code> the same option multiple times (sometimes a few dozen times).</p>

<p>This is actually one of my biggest complaints about this game. There are too many sequences that won’t advance until you repeat the same option many times until a new selection becomes available in the menu. Often the feedback you get from Gillian or Metal Gear will be the same for many of those selections so it’s not obvious that they’re waiting for you to keep repeating the option.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/snatcher/Snatcher 2023-06-25 07.54.41.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Overall this game was a pleasant surprise. The story is really compelling and well structured, and though it can be challenging to get it to progress in certain areas, it’s generally an intuitive game to play.</p>

<p>I’m a huge fan of cyberpunk in general, and I like visual novels and menu driven games so Snatcher sort of hit a number of gaming sweet spots for me. The music is atmospheric and adds to the experience nicely, and the voice acting quality was better than I would have expected.</p>

<p>For anyone looking for a story that feels like it’s in the Blade Runner universe, look no further than Snatcher.</p>
