See all reviewed games sorted by rating here. Since I just finished playing Police Quest 1 I figured I’ll stick with the “police work simulator” category and pick up Blue Force next. Blue Force was also designed by Police Quest designer Jim Walls so there are some thematic similarities between the titles. You have to use proper radio codes... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Police Quest: In Pursuit of the Death Angel</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/03/15/police-quest-1/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Police Quest: In Pursuit of the Death Angel" /><published>2022-03-15T06:39:40-04:00</published> <updated>2022-03-15T07:18:24-04:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/03/15/police-quest-1/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/03/15/police-quest-1/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="Let's Adventure!" /> <summary> This review is part of the “Let’s Adventure!” series.

It was remade in 1992 using 256-color VGA graphics and the SCI engine, which dramatically improved the app... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Performance Analysis of Resuming a MongoDB Change Stream</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/03/02/performance-analysis-of-resuming-a-mongodb-change-stream/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Performance Analysis of Resuming a MongoDB Change Stream" /><published>2022-03-02T06:50:39-05:00</published> <updated>2022-03-15T07:18:24-04:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/03/02/performance-analysis-of-resuming-a-mongodb-change-stream/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/03/02/performance-analysis-of-resuming-a-mongodb-change-stream/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="MongoDB" /> <summary> Change Streams allow applications to access real-time data changes without the complexity and risk of tailing the oplog. Applications can use change streams to subscribe to all data changes on a single collection, a database, or an entire deployment, and immediately react to them. For applications that rely on change streams, ensuring continuity on process restart can be accomplished by specif... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Cleaning Up ETL Results in MongoDB by Transposing Multiple Arrays</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/02/07/cleaning-up-etl-results-in-mongodb-by-transposing-multiple-arrays/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cleaning Up ETL Results in MongoDB by Transposing Multiple Arrays" /><published>2022-02-07T09:05:00-05:00</published> <updated>2022-02-08T08:53:17-05:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/02/07/cleaning-up-etl-results-in-mongodb-by-transposing-multiple-arrays/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/02/07/cleaning-up-etl-results-in-mongodb-by-transposing-multiple-arrays/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="MongoDB" /> <summary> When performing an ETL from a normalized relational dataset there’s a good chance a 1:1 conversion won’t produce the desired results on the first pass. For example, if the goal is to Model One-to-Many Relationships with Embedded Documents but the dataset contains a number of relationships mapped to individual fields as arrays of scalar values, you’ll likely want to convert these to subdocuments... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Generate MongoDB Index Utilization Report</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/01/24/generate-mongodb-index-utilization-report/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Generate MongoDB Index Utilization Report" /><published>2022-01-24T09:49:50-05:00</published> <updated>2022-02-07T10:12:17-05:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/01/24/generate-mongodb-index-utilization-report/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/01/24/generate-mongodb-index-utilization-report/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="MongoDB" /> <summary> When MongoDB 3.2 introduced the $indexStats aggregation pipeline stage accesses details were suddenly accessible to users. As a result, scripts could now be written to better understand how frequently indexes were being accessed by operations. The following script will cycle through all databases and collections (omitting admin, local and config) to produce a delimited report of index utilizat... </summary> </entry> </feed>
