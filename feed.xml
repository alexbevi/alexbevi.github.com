<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Outer_Space_(video_game)">Plan 9 from Outer Space</a> is a point and click adventure game adaptation of the film of the same name. It was developed at the Irish office of Gremlin Graphics for the Amiga and Atari ST, and was released in 1992. The game was published by Gremlin in Europe and by Konami in the United States. A DOS version was also developed, though only released in the US and Europe. Two editions of the game were made available at retail; the more common version was packaged with a VHS copy of the film, while a rarer version contained only the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/070.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The movie; Plan 9‚Ä¶..the critics hated it. But, the producer of the film has noticed that it‚Äôs been stolen by Bela Lugosi‚Äôs double. Find him. Track him. For God‚Äôs sake - just keep a straight head when you enter this part of the movie lot and town. Some of the most misguided people roam here! Most important‚Ä¶..get the film back!<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/039.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I‚Äôve heard of the movie, and may even have seen it at some point in the past thirty years ‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt remember anything about it other than having a legacy of being a terrible movie. This doesn‚Äôt really set the stage for a good gaming experience, but here we go anyway.</p>

<p>Since my expectations were extremely low for this game to begin with, I figured I should play the Amiga version as my go-to emulator <a href="https://dirkwhoffmann.github.io/vAmiga/">vAmiga</a> has a handy-dandy fast-forward feature.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/038.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The <a href="https://retro-commodore.eu/files/downloads/amigamanuals-xiik.net/Games/Plan%209%20From%20Outer%20Space%20-%20Manual-DE-ENG-FR.pdf">game manual</a> doesn‚Äôt really set the stage for the game, and you‚Äôre sort of just dropped into a Movie Producer‚Äôs office who tells you you need to get the film back ‚Ä¶ and off you go.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/041.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There‚Äôs some basic copy protection to kick things off, but I opted for a cracked copy of the game to bypass this. The fine crackers at <a href="https://demozoo.org/groups/2904/">TKK</a> (only active for a brief period in ‚Äò92 is seems) don‚Äôt seem to have included a cracktro, though it seems there are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q4rbvd2of4">examples of their work</a> if you‚Äôre curious.</p>

<p>The game‚Äôs interface is reminiscent of the MacVenture games, though in this case the vast majority of the screen is unused (just a static background). You have a small game window, and inventory list to the right of this and your verb list at the bottom right.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/043.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you explore or interact with the world and characters, a summary of these interactions fills the bottom left of the screen. Text sort of just rolls off though and there‚Äôs no scroll back so it‚Äôs easy to miss details if you‚Äôre not paying attention.</p>

<p>I found it a little hard to read the white text on the blue background, and the fact that each new interaction was indented just looked odd, but those are minor annoyances.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/047.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The graphics aren‚Äôt bad, but they‚Äôre nothing to write home about. Almost every male character uses the same model so they kind of blend together, and no one has anything interesting to say. Since I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do other than visit each screen, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EXAMINE</code> everything and move on it sort of felt like work to plod along this ‚Äúadventure‚Äù.</p>

<p>You‚Äôre supposed to find a handful of movie reels spread across various cities, and typically you‚Äôll need to complete some form of fetch quest to gain access to the place where the reel is.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/048.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are multiple locations you‚Äôll need to explore, and these aren‚Äôt accessible until you discover them - either by examining something (like a pamphlet for the mall) or by talking to a character (the woman at the bar tells you where Bela Lugosi‚Äôs house is).</p>

<p>At each location there may be an opportunity to pick items up for later use, but inventory management is a pretty big gameplay mechanic. You only have limited ‚Äúweight‚Äù you can carry - so you‚Äôll frequently need to drop items in order to pick up new items.</p>

<p>Thankfully when you drop items some little creature picks it up and takes it back to the original location you found it. This makes it easy to backtrack and reacquire items you had to leave behind.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/053.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you find the film reels, you can take them to projection booths scattered throughout the game. Each booth has the same attendant working there that you can give a reel to and he‚Äôll play it for you. I‚Äôm assuming these are clips from the original movie - which you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsb74pW7goU">watch on YouTube</a> if you‚Äôre curious üëÄ.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/061.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Talking to various characters you meet progresses the ‚Äúplot‚Äù, but you need to be careful which dialogue options you pick as you can softlock the game by choosing the wrong option. For example, you need to ask this woman about the weather so that you can offer her beads and learn about a hippy camp.</p>

<p>If you hit on her first, there doesn‚Äôt appear to be a way to reset the conversation and you‚Äôre sort of stuck.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/065.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though infrequent, certain scenarios can result in a game over. I was playing this game in fast-forward for the majority of my time with the game as I had to start from scratch a couple times (due to softlocks), and because fast-forward mutes the music.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs one track that loops for the duration of the game, and there are very few sound effects. When there ARE sound effects, they tend to be extremely annoying (shrill and loud) - like the sounds in the cab or the bats in the cave.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/069.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The first half of the game all takes place in the multiple locations you travel to by cab around the studio. The second half of the game has you flying between Washington, Australia, Rio and Hong Kong. These cities you fly to have a cab outside the airport that will take you to the one location per city you can visit.</p>

<p>These travel options just sort of add padding to the various fetch quests, but that‚Äôs about it.</p>

<p>Eventually you‚Äôll be hired by the CIA to go to Cuba to do ‚Ä¶ something. While you‚Äôre there, if you happened to bring the dictionary with you you can get the Cuban guard to give you some cigars and a poster that proves ‚Ä¶ something.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/076.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You‚Äôll ultimately have to also go find some film for a guy in Hong Kong, which after you bring it back he gives you a talisman that you give to some monks - who then lead you to the aliens or something.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/077.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I just didn‚Äôt get it. I should probably watch the film, but this game is unlikely to add anything to that experience. Maybe if you‚Äôre a fan of the original film there‚Äôs an enjoyable experience to be had here, but I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb and say that for fans of the film - the game probably still sucks.</p>

<p>Though I would not recommend this game to anyone, it‚Äôs oddly satisfying knowing that the ‚Äúworst movie ever made‚Äù also sort of translates to one of the worst gaming experiences on my list.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Quest_III">King‚Äôs Quest III: To Heir Is Human</a> is the third installment in the King‚Äôs Quest series of graphic adventure games developed and released by Sierra On-Line in 1986. The game was originally released for the Apple II and MS-DOS, and later ported to several other computer systems. It was the first title game in the series not to feature King Graham as the player character.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00018.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>King Graham and Queen Valanice had two children, Alexander and Rosella, and the kingdom was once peaceful. It wasn‚Äôt long until Alexander was snatched from his crib and things started to take a turn for the worse. A three-headed dragon threatens the ever-peaceful Daventry, and requires a maiden to be sacrificed every year. Rosella is the chosen one.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in a secluded house atop a mountain in the land of Llewdor, the evil wizard called Manannan keeps a young lad named Gwydion as his slave, forcing him to do menial tasks as he prepares his spells and observes the country through his telescope. Gwydion must find a way to outsmart the wizard, escape, and eventually discover the truth about his own identity.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I‚Äôm pretty sure I was about 8 years old when I first got a copy of King‚Äôs Quest III for our 386. Since a friend of mine made me a copy of the game and I didn‚Äôt have the <a href="https://mocagh.org/sierra/kq3brcc-manual.pdf">manual</a>, I printed off a copy someone had typed up and uploaded to a local BBS.</p>

<p>For me, King‚Äôs Quest III brings back memories of learning how to touch type. These old AGI games that I played as I was learning how to work with computers sort of forced me to become a better typist because hunting and pecking for letters while there‚Äôs a timer running meant I used to die a lot.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00006.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You start off in a wizard‚Äôs house on top of a hill. He‚Äôll give you a task that you need to complete, and you‚Äôve only got a certain amount of time to complete it in before he gets mad at you and zaps you.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm pretty sure you have about 5 minutes of in-game time to do the initial task, which is actually plenty of time given how small the house is. This gives you a chance to explore a bit, interact with the world and start collecting some items.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00003.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you‚Äôve read the manual, you know there are a number of spells you‚Äôll need to prepare - and these are prepared using various items you collect throughout the game. As a result, you‚Äôll find yourself picking up pretty much everything that isn‚Äôt nailed down on ever screen you visit.</p>

<p>The problem though is that when the wizard comes back to check on you, if you have any magical items in your inventory he‚Äôll assume you‚Äôre up to no good and kill you on the spot.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00019.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When you bring up your inventory you‚Äôll notice that some items have an asterisk at the end of their entries. This is how you differentiate magical items from normal items. If you pick up any of these items while the wizard is out, you‚Äôll need to stash them under your bed before he gets back.</p>

<p>I honestly can‚Äôt remember if I figured this out through trial and error, if someone told me about it or if I read it in a walkthrough, but it wasn‚Äôt obvious to me that this was what you needed to do. As a result, though I have fond memories of this game - I also remember it being extremely frustrating and annoying to play.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00007.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When you finish your first task for the wizard, he (eventually) will appear and tell you he‚Äôs going to go off on a journey. This ends up giving you about 30 minutes of in-game time to figure out what to do next.</p>

<p>Since this wizard is a pain in your ass, you might as well try to get him out of your way first. Based on the spells you have recipes for, it seems like turning him into a cat might be your ticket to freedom.</p>

<p>This spell only requires a couple ingredients (mandrake root powder, ball of cat hair, fish oil, magic wand), and you‚Äôre able to find 75% of these in the wizard‚Äôs house. Since the fish oil isn‚Äôt here, you venture down the mountain to explore the world.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00008.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The mountain path is a pain in the ass, but given this is a Sierra game released in the late 80s you sort of expect every step to potentially lead to a game over. This was just how these games were designed, and if you‚Äôd played any other titles released around that time - you knew this was coming.</p>

<p>Unless you‚Äôre playing with a walkthrough it‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôd be able to collect everything from in and around town in your first outing, so you‚Äôll need to make the trek back up the mountain to the wizard‚Äôs house a few times - trying not to fall off the cliff each time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00015.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you can fall off of anything (not just the cliff), expect a game over. This game will give you many opportunities to shoot yourself in the foot, and you‚Äôll likely muddle your way into those scenarios more often than not, so save early (and often).</p>

<p>Finding the fish oil is easy enough as it‚Äôs sold at the store in town, but you don‚Äôt have any money. You‚Äôll need to steal gold from some bandits to buy this, but first you need to find their hideout - then get in without being caught. Once you figure all this out though you can return to the wizard‚Äôs house to whip up your first spell.</p>

<p>One item you‚Äôll find early on is the magic map, which allows you to quick travel to any location you‚Äôve previously visited. This is extremely convenient for warping from the wizard‚Äôs house down the mountain, but it doesn‚Äôt work to get you back to the house. As a result, plan to (safely) climb back up the mountain multiple times.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00024.png" alt="" />
<em>Typing these out whisks me back to the first dozen times I played this and didn‚Äôt know what ‚Äúsoporific‚Äù meant</em></p>

<p>With spell ingredients in hand, you find the wizard‚Äôs lair in the basement of the house, and flip to a specific page in the spell book to start preparing a spell. Having to laboriously type out the spells exactly as the manual describes is a good form of copy protection, but after the first couple spells it does become tedious.</p>

<p>You‚Äôll need to prepare multiple spells, so you‚Äôll be back in the basement a few times throughout the first half of the game as you get everything ready to eventually leave the island.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00020.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Any tiny mistake you make during spell preparation is a game over - but at least it‚Äôs kind of funny. Gwydion will transform himself partially as a result of the failed spell, and the results are specific to the spell you were trying to prepare (my favourite is him turning half into a fly).</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre able to get the first spell completed, you‚Äôll end up with a magic cookie that when eaten will turn the consumer into a cat. If you try to give this to Manannan, it‚Äôs a magic item so he‚Äôll just kill you. You need to hide the cookie in something else and give that to him, but if you didn‚Äôt get the porridge from the 3 bears house - you‚Äôre out of luck.</p>

<p>Without the right items, you‚Äôll have to give Manannan something else to eat from the kitchen, then wait for him to leave again and go get the porridge and wait for him to come back again. Once you feed him the magic porridge, he turns into a cat and you have free reign of the world to finish collecting magical items, mixing spells and figuring out what to do next.</p>

<p>If you find the oracle she‚Äôll tell you you have a sister that‚Äôs a princess, that you‚Äôre a prince and you have to go save her. You‚Äôll find some pirates in the bar and pay them to get access to their ship.</p>

<p>They sort of kidnap you at this point, and you have to wait (and wait and wait and wait) for 15-20 minutes for the ship to progress far enough that the game will allow you to progress.</p>

<p>The timer is not a welcome element to this game, so I‚Äôm glad it doesn‚Äôt make an appearance in any subsequent titles in the series.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00034.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you get off the pirate ship (using one of your spells and the magic map), you‚Äôll end up in Daventry and it‚Äôs a short jaunt up to the dragon that is holding your sister captive. There‚Äôs some minor platforming here (climbing the cliff and navigating caves), but you eventually get there, cast a couple spells and escort your sister back to the castle.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00036.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though I have fond memories of this game, it‚Äôs not really much fun. The whole experience sort of feels like work and there isn‚Äôt really much to do once you reach the pirate ship but wait. If you use the map too early, you‚Äôll drown ‚Ä¶ so you have to wait. Waiting is too common a theme in this game.</p>

<p>KQ3 does give you some quality of life improvements over the previous 2 entries in the series, but it‚Äôs not really adding much to the overall gaming experience. Most game screens don‚Äôt have any background music, so you play in silence for the majority of the game.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the game involves fetching ingredients for spells, so once you‚Äôve completed that all you really have to do is get to the dragon. Trying to get past the snow monster is a little frustrating, but that‚Äôs the only real challenge once you get off the ship.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00028.png" alt="" />
<em>Yup, you‚Äôve still got some waiting to do</em></p>

<p>I do like this game, but it‚Äôs a bit tedious to play nowadays. There were however remakes (yes - plural) by <a href="https://infamousadventures.itch.io/kings-quest-iii-vga-remake">Infamous Adventures</a> and <a href="https://www.agdinteractive.com/games/kq3/about/overview.html">AGD Interactive</a> that drop the text parser in favour of a more traditional P&amp;C interface.</p>

<p>I couldn‚Äôt get KQ3 Redux working on my Macbook (the game was released in 2011), but the Infamous Adventures release works perfectly. I would recommend trying one of these remakes if you want to experience the game today.</p>

<p>There have been several video games based on the 1991 film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(video_game)">Hook</a>. A side-scrolling platform game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Game Boy was released in the United States in February 1992. Subsequent side-scrolling platform games were released for the Commodore 64 and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), and an arcade beat ‚Äòem up by Irem later in 1992, followed by versions for the Sega CD, Sega Genesis, and Sega‚Äôs handheld Game Gear console in 1993.</p>

<p>A graphic adventure point-and-click game, developed and published by Ocean Software, was released for Amiga, Atari ST, and DOS in 1992 - which is what this review focuses on.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/016.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Peter Banning is an ordinary suburban dad with two kids - or so everyone thinks. What not even his family know is his past as Peter Pan, scourge of Captain Hook in JM Barrie‚Äôs children‚Äôs fiction. Captain Hook gains revenge on Banning by stealing his two children, so Peter must return to Neverland, return to eternal childhood, and get them back.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a point and click adventure, and the pirate setting ensures that it recalls the Monkey Island games. The top 2/3 of the screen features a visual depiction of the area Peter is in, which a row of icons along the bottom can be selected to alter the function of a mouse click. These include looking at an object, picking it up, talking to people, using objects to solve problems (often in combination with others), and giving objects to others.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/014.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Like most good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_Disk_File">Amiga disk file</a> based games you can find on the internet, this one was cracked by one of the notable cracking groups of the time - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairlight_(group)">Fairlight</a>. Though I don‚Äôt condone piracy (and a number of FLT members got caught during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Fastlink">Operation Fastlink</a> a decade later), for these 30+ year old games you need hardware emulators to play ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm willing to ‚Äúbend‚Äù the rules a bit ‚Ä¶</p>

<p>I know of touched on this in previous reviews, but for those of us revisiting some of these ripped/cracked copies of games after 30+ years there is definitely a sense of nostalgia when you see a familiar cracktro.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/040.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>With the rise of services like GOG and Steam, quick and convenient access to digital copies of games is no longer an issue, so these demo scenes inserted into cracked binaries are now just an artifact of the past.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a great collection of Fairlight‚Äôs demos at <a href="https://demozoo.org/groups/239/">DEMOZOO</a> for anyone that may be interested.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/022.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Since this game is based on the 1991 Steven Spielberg movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(film)">‚ÄúHook‚Äù</a>, I assumed the plot would sort of follow the film‚Äôs (which I believe it does, but I haven‚Äôt seen the movie in a very long time). You play as Peter, your kids have been kidnapped and you need to get them back. You‚Äôre secretly Peter Pan, but since you grew up you‚Äôve lost the sense of wonder and magic that would allow you to fly - and this is what you‚Äôll need to get your kids back.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/015a.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game starts off with a brief cinematic sequence which sets up the main story. Hook has your kids, and to get them back you‚Äôll need to make your way back to Neverland - which Tinkerbell fills you in on, wraps you in a blanket and carries you off.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/018.png" alt="" />
<em>A bloody hacksaw and a bucket of blood? I don‚Äôt trust this dentist ‚Ä¶</em></p>

<p>Once you land in the pirate town, you‚Äôre sort of on your own. There‚Äôs no indication what you‚Äôll need to do or where to go, so you sort of just start wandering around. What I found frustrating almost immediately is that you can‚Äôt move your cursor around and surface hotspots; not you need to select the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code> action, then click on things randomly.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/021.png" alt="" />
<em>This gets annoying really quickly</em></p>

<p>If there‚Äôs something to look at, it‚Äôll tell you - otherwise you get a generic message. This is frustrating because the game de-selects the magnifying glass icon after you use it, so you have to click it again and click back on the screen as you go pixel-hunting. If you <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TALK</code> to Tinkerbell, she‚Äôll occasionally give you hints as to what you can do next, so that‚Äôs helpful.</p>

<p>Thankfully this game only has a couple dozen areas you can visit, so there‚Äôs really not all that many locations you‚Äôll have to do this at. Most of the time it‚Äôs fairly obvious that there‚Äôs an item you can pick up or interact with ‚Ä¶ but not always.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/027.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To advance the story you‚Äôll have to interact with the various NPCs scattered about the game. There‚Äôs a very basic conversation system that involves right clicking to select what you want to ask, then left clicking to ask what you‚Äôve selected. Typically there are only 3-4 options to choose from, with one being a hint as to what the fetch quest you‚Äôll need to perform for that character will be.</p>

<p>For such a short game, there are a lot of items you‚Äôll need to collect. It‚Äôs usually not too difficult to figure out which character needs what, but there are also unused items you‚Äôll collect. This was frustrating as I found myself backtracking near the end game trying to use these items on various characters to see if I‚Äôd missed anything.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/023.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Your goals in this game are pretty simple. First, you need to find Captain Hook - but to do this you need to dress up as a pirate to get on his ship. Then, once you meet him, he challenges you to a duel, but you need to become Peter Pan again. To do that you need to get your memories back, which the Lost Boys can help you do.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs basically it. Getting the pieces of pirate clothing is surprisingly frustrating, as it‚Äôs really not obvious how many pieces you need, or once you have them how to put them on (this was walkthrough-checking territory for me).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/017.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For example, to get the pirate hat you‚Äôll need to build grappling hook from an anchor and rope. When you get up to the location where you should use this, Peter tells you he‚Äôs not going to do this TWICE, before he actually throws it and swings. This is frustrating as the game really makes it appear as though you‚Äôre doing something wrong, so why would you KEEP TRYING?</p>

<p>Once you do swing to the other side of the town square, you actually need to time it properly to snag the hat of the pirate walking back and forth. This ALSO isn‚Äôt obvious, and you‚Äôll miss 99% of the time. Peter doesn‚Äôt indicate he was trying to grab something and missed, so it‚Äôs easy to just swing over and back without realizing you‚Äôre supposed to grab a hat at all.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/030.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The story will progress through the Neverwood and into the Lost Boys hideout, where you need to get your memories back so you can remember a happy memory that will allow you to fly. Tinkerbell helps you get there, but first there are a whole bunch of item combination puzzles and fetch quests you‚Äôll need to complete.</p>

<p>Make sure you examine everything you pick up, because a few times the items aren‚Äôt useable, but they actually conceal another item you‚Äôll need - such as the fishing net, which you only need a piece of string from to make a bow.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/034.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you remember you‚Äôre Peter Pan, a cutscene will play out and you‚Äôll fly back to Hook‚Äôs ship to challenge him to a duel. This plays out similar to Monkey Island‚Äôs <a href="https://monkeyisland.fandom.com/wiki/Insult_Sword_Fighting">insult sword fighting</a>, but with much lower stakes.</p>

<p>If you pick the right answer, you push Hook to the left (towards the plank), and if you pick incorrectly, he pushes you to the right. You can‚Äôt lose though, so if you pick wrong, just keep trying until you eventually make him walk the plank and win the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/038.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Hook is not bad, but it‚Äôs nothing special. The graphics are decent, and the sound effects and periodic background music enhance the experience sufficiently. Though there‚Äôs no points system in this game, when you solve various item combination puzzles you‚Äôll see Captain Hook get REALLY angry in the lower left of your screen.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/039.png" alt="" />
<em>He‚Äôs big mad that I figured out how to build that bow</em></p>

<p>A lot of the story progression is based on you having prior knowledge of Peter Pan, so the game doesn‚Äôt really fill too much more in for you. The Lost Boys are sort of just there, and act as basic NPCs to nudge you along your journey, but don‚Äôt add any depth or value beyond that.</p>

<p><a href="https://advgamer.blogspot.com/search/label/Hook">The Adventurers Guild</a> did a great review of this game that I‚Äôd highly recommend. It‚Äôs also how I learned that the game‚Äôs designer <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/31699/kevin-oxland/">Kevin Oxland</a> has a book out on game design (called <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Gameplay-design-Kevin-Oxland/dp/0321204670">Gameplay and Design</a>) that I might just have to check out.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Quest_6">Space Quest 6: Roger Wilco in the Spinal Frontier</a> is a point-and-click adventure game developed and published by Sierra On-Line in 1995. It is the sixth and final game in the Space Quest series, though (spoiler) the game ends on a cliffhanger that will ultimately never be resolved.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq6/scummvm-sq6-00005.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Roger Wilco, the brave interstellar janitor who has already saved the universe from many great dangers, is now in a very embarrassing position. His commanders show no respect for his courageous actions in the previous game. Instead, he is being accused of all kinds of violations against the galactic law, is deprived of all the honors he got in the previous game, and as a token of mercy, is allowed to return to his old job - cleaning closets‚Ä¶ But those unfortunate events are just the beginning of much bigger troubles Roger will get into. Once again, the future of galaxy depends on him!<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq6/scummvm-sq6-00022.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This final entry in the series runs on the later SCI32 engine Rev 2.100.002 (aka <a href="http://sciwiki.sierrahelp.com/index.php/Sierra_SCI_Release_List#SCI2.1_.28middle.29">SCI2.1 (middle)</a>), which allowed it to use SVGA graphics with 256 colors at 640√ó480 resolution. Unlike other SCI games, it did not have the interface in a pull down bar at the top of the screen, but instead used a ‚Äúverb bar‚Äù window along the bottom of the screen, similar to LucasArts‚Äô SCUMM engine. The graphics style was also more cartoonish than in previous games, as well as incorporating an ample amount of 3-D rendered images.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq6/scummvm-sq6-00021.png" alt="" />
<em>I don‚Äôt love the visual style of the human characters‚Ä¶</em></p>

<p>I appreciated the updated visual style of the backgrounds and the UI, but honestly the closeup shots of any humanoid character just looked ‚Ä¶ off. Though there was clearly a lot of work put into the character design, I miss the pixel art of <a href="/blog/2024/09/10/space-quest-v/">Space Quest V</a>.</p>

<p>An increased colour palette and next-gen SCI game engine sort of left everything looking ‚Äúflat‚Äù in my opinion.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq6/scummvm-sq6-00020.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The cutscenes have not aged well, and are reminiscent of basically all 3-D rendered scenes of the early to mid 90s. I can‚Äôt really fault Sierra for this as this is just an artifact of the games of that era.</p>

<p>Most cutscenes felt more like filler than substance, and were just there to eat up some time. They could occasionally become repetitive and tedious if they were triggered every time you needed to backtrack (like with the ‚Äúriding the tapeworm‚Äù sequence near the end).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq6/scummvm00054.2.bmp" alt="" />
<em>Roger is really trying to push both buttons at once - and is - but it doesn‚Äôt look like it in ScummVM</em></p>

<p>While playing through the game I thought I hit some weird visual bug, but apparently it‚Äôs well known and only present in ScummVM (<a href="https://bugs.scummvm.org/ticket/9749">#9749 - SCI: SQ6: Shuttle Bay Entrance bug</a>). ScummVM‚Äôs developers have included many, many improvements to SCI engine games (including <a href="https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/blob/master/engines/sci/engine/script_patches.cpp#L25289-L25318">script patches for SQ6</a>), however apparently the issue here is a little different.</p>

<p>Sierra actually <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5287446A">patented</a> their <a href="http://sciwiki.sierrahelp.com/index.php/ToDo/Pathfinding/Patent">pathfinding algorithm</a>, so the ScummVM engineers had to do their own version of it instead. This can result in some visual anomalies like in the screenshot above.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq6/scummvm-sq6-00008.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As with most Sierra adventure games, you run around picking stuff up in hopes of using it later to solve some puzzle. The inventory puzzles in this game weren‚Äôt all that challenging, and it was actually pretty clever how the fish kept ending up in your possession as you progressed.</p>

<p>I assumed this was being set up as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring">‚Äúred herring‚Äù</a> gag, but this fish would actually end up being the solution to the final puzzle in the game (spoiler), so several times when you were about to leave an area permanently, a character threw it to you so you‚Äôd have it again.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq6/scummvm-sq6-00012.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Overall, the voice acting is not great. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to disable speech altogether though because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Owens">Gary Owens</a> as the narrator just crushes it. If it weren‚Äôt for his dry, sarcastic delivery throughout the game I‚Äôd likely knock several more points off the <em>Sound</em> score.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq6/scummvm-sq6-00024.png" alt="" />
<em>By far, this is my favourite scene in the game</em></p>

<p>Whereas the previous game was a parody of Star Trek, Space Quest 6 is a mishmash of various science fiction properties that were popular at the time the game came out. Almost every name and location is a parody or pun - which if you‚Äôre in on the joke adds to the experience. I‚Äôm not sure how accessible the writing of the game is to a modern audience as a result.</p>

<p>The overarching plot involves Roger initially being targeted for ‚ÄúProject Immortality‚Äù, but instead his colleague Stellar Santiago is taken (after she saves Roger‚Äôs life). He then needs to rescue her by first finding her, then being shrunk down to enter her digestive system and destroy some nanobots.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq6/scummvm-sq6-00029.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I really didn‚Äôt find the story to be all that interesting and it was mostly forgettable. The puzzles aren‚Äôt overly difficult, and typically just involve fetch quests and backtracking. The game‚Äôs locations aren‚Äôt that expansive, so searching everywhere doesn‚Äôt take all that long, and though there‚Äôs a bit of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pixel_hunting">pixel-hunting</a> on certain screens, key items are typically out in the open.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq6/scummvm-sq6-00017.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt find nearly as many interesting ways to die as I would have in previous games, and the message you‚Äôre prompted with is fairly generic. This was part of the fun of the Space Quest series, and I found after about an hour of playing the game I didn‚Äôt bother messing around to see how I might die as it just wasn‚Äôt proving to be all that entertaining.</p>

<p>For new gamers it‚Äôs appreciated that you get a ‚ÄúTry Again‚Äù option, which just rewinds back to right before you made a mistake and doesn‚Äôt force you to rely on an earlier save. It‚Äôs fairly obvious most of the time though what the ‚Äúright‚Äù choice is, so you likely won‚Äôt die too often.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq6/scummvm-sq6-00033.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Space Quest 6 ends on a cliffhanger, but since there was never a sequel made this is effectively where the series concludes. The game doesn‚Äôt have the same feel as the previous 5 entries in the series, and this is likely due to it not actually being made by the ‚ÄúTwo Guys from Andromeda‚Äù, but instead <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Mandel_(video_game_designer)">Josh Mandel</a>.</p>

<p>Mandel designed the game, but left near the end of production and Scott Murphy (on of the ‚ÄúTwo Guys‚Äù) came in to finish it off. This is likely why some of the gameplay feels uneven, which is confirmed in a 2006 interview with Josh Mandel:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>‚ÄúOne of the inventory items cut was a comic book CD in Nigel‚Äôs room that was fully readable and had all the hints to the Datacorder puzzle. From a writing and design standpoint, it was fully finished, and I know that Barry Smith had started the artwork. I don‚Äôt understand why it was cut. But the comic book content was something I‚Äôd worked on for months, and it was something that I was uncharacteristically proud of ‚Ä¶ I think it would‚Äôve been one of the greatest parody sequences in the SQ series. So not only was I very upset not to see it in the game, but the fact that they had to put the Datacorder hints in the manual, leading player to think it was meant to be copy protection, disturbed me greatly.‚Äù</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq6/scummvm-sq6-00011.png" alt="" />
<em>I guess this wasn‚Äôt meant to be copy protection</em></p>

<p>The Datacorder puzzle did feel like copy protection, so I feel Josh‚Äôs frustration and am genuinely curious as to what the comic book CD experience would have been like. I guess we‚Äôll never know, just like we‚Äôll never know what Stellar Santiago meant when she said we were ‚Äúgoing to like the next mission‚Äù ‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Space Quest 6 isn‚Äôt great, but it‚Äôs good enough to play through at least once. If you‚Äôre only going to play one game in the series though, I‚Äôd recommend either <a href="/blog/2024/02/16/space-quest-iii/">Space Quest III</a> or <a href="/blog/2024/09/10/space-quest-v/">Space Quest V</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_a_Killing_Moon">Under a Killing Moon</a> is a 1994 point-and-click adventure interactive movie video game. It is the third installment in the Tex Murphy series of adventure games produced by Access Software.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_050.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It is December of the year 2042. The world is still recovering from the disastrous consequences of the World War III. Radioactivity has turned many humans into mutants, and the gap between those and the ‚Äúnorms‚Äù (non-affected humans) is growing wider. Certain places in the world have retained the feel and the charm of the old times - among those is the Old San Francisco. There, the private investigator Tex Murphy is trying to deal with unemployment, upcoming poverty, and his melancholic mood following his divorce. After solving a simple robbery case, Tex attracts the attention of a mysterious woman who calls herself Countess Renier, and is hired by her to find a missing statuette. Things gradually begin to go wrong in this investigation, and Tex finds himself involved in a confrontation with a powerful and dangerous secret cult.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_004.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Under a Killing Moon</em> is the sequel to Access Software‚Äôs previous title <em>Martian Memorandum</em>. Though I haven‚Äôt played through this one yet, I have previously covered <a href="/blog/2023/01/19/mean-streets/">Mean Streets</a> and <a href="/blog/2023/04/20/countdown/">Countdown</a> - the first being a Tex Murphy adventure.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm a fan of old detective movies and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir">film noir</a> genre in general, so the introductory cut scene really hooked me right away and drew me into the dystopian future that was this game‚Äôs world.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_006.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Right from the beginning you feel like you‚Äôre in a movie, which if you‚Äôve watched the documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tooF40ktbdM">‚ÄúThe Making of Tex Murphy‚Äù</a> reinforces this further as the game developers really wanted to make movies.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/07/under-a-killing-moon/">The Digital Antiquarian‚Äôs <em>Under a Killing Moon</em></a> article, Tex Murphy first appeared in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_10_from_Outer_Space">Plan 10 from Outer Space</a> before eventually being repurposed as the protagonist in various Access Software titles:</p>

Jones took the starring role of a private detective born in the wrong time, who channeled not only Humphrey Bogart but also Roy Rogers, what with his penchant for yodeling cowboy tunes. The detective-cum-cowboy‚Äôs name was Tex Murphy.</p>

<p>Before diving into <em>Under a Killing Moon</em>, you first need to install and configure it. There‚Äôs something really nostalgic about the design of these DOS era configuration screens that try to make it as easy as possible to configure your sound card.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm pretty sure I never had more than one device ever (at a time) so my digital sound and music devices were always the same, but in this modern age of emulation, might as well splurge and setup a faux-MT 32 for all the music this game has to offer.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_029.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You play as Tex Murphy, who‚Äôs a down on his luck private investigator looking for his next job. The game opens with a cinematic cutscene, then drops you into Tex‚Äôs office, which you can fully explore in 3D.</p>

<p>The game comes with 2 navigation modes - interactive and exploration. When you‚Äôre in exploration mode, you can move around the environment as if you‚Äôre playing DOOM. Tex can look all around using the mouse to control your field of vision, but you can also ‚Äústand‚Äù and ‚Äúcrouch‚Äù to see above and below things.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_048.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>A pretty big part of the game‚Äôs puzzle design revolves around this mechanic of panning and tilting the camera to see over and into things. If there‚Äôs ever a trash can in a room, it‚Äôs worth having a look into as there‚Äôs usually something in there you‚Äôll need to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_049.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>What you‚Äôll often find in these trash cans are pieces of notes you‚Äôll need to reassemble. This can be extremely time consuming to complete, but the game does at least give you instructions each time that lets you know what the goal of the puzzle is, and how to manipulate the pieces.</p>

<p>Each note reassembly puzzle is slightly different, so I appreciate that it didn‚Äôt just feel like busy work, but it‚Äôs obvious the designers were proud of this mechanic and wanted to reuse it as often as possible.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_035.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There‚Äôs more to collect in this game than just ripped up notes you need to put back together, and these are all stored in your inventory. Each item can be either examined, used or combined - and it‚Äôs worth trying all 3 of these options with literally everything you pick up.</p>

<p>Examining items is a requirement as many times the item you initially picked up isn‚Äôt actually the thing you want. Examining it shows a 3D view of the item as it‚Äôs rotated, and you may discover a compartment with a key, or you‚Äôll open it up and take something out - discarding the initial item in the process.</p>

<p>Though there are several item combination puzzles, the end result is typically pretty obvious, so the various items you need to collect and combine to form the final item are also pretty obvious.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_056.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To navigate around the world of <em>Under a Killing Moon</em>, you have access to a quick travel map. New locations are added based on conversations with characters or by examining certain inventory items.</p>

<p>Many locations aren‚Äôt actually ‚Äúexplorable‚Äù, but simply contain a single character you can talk to. This can make the game world look a lot bigger than it is.</p>

<p>Since it‚Äôs REALLY easy to miss picking up key items in this game, the map is actually extremely useful. For locations (like Chandler Ave.) where there are several places you can visit, you can actually go directly to a key location right away by selecting it from the map.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_030.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The story progresses through interactions with a couple dozen characters you‚Äôll meet throughout your adventure. Instead of the typical dialogue tree adventure games present you with, <em>Under a Killing Moon</em> relies on a 3 options system used to set the tone of the question you want to ask.</p>

<p>Typically the option you select won‚Äôt matter, and the conversation will proceed ‚Äúon rails‚Äù, but if you‚Äôre not careful with certain people you‚Äôll miss key details if you pick the wrong options - or even get yourself killed!</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_031.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Dying in this game brings you back to the big detective in the sky, who will let you know it‚Äôs not your time yet and give you another chance.</p>

<p>You may also get a clue as to how you should have proceeded. Since this section is voiced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Earl_Jones">James Earl Jones</a>, it‚Äôs at least a bit enjoyable hearing him reassure you that it‚Äôs not your time and you should get back out there and try again.</p>

<p>Hopefully you remembered to save your game recently, as restore a previous save is the only option here - other than restarting from the beginning.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_059.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though saving early and often is pretty standard fare for an adventure game, it‚Äôs worth calling out <em>Under a Killing Moon</em>‚Äôs storage system.</p>

<p>When you start the game, you create a player, which is what you‚Äôll be storing your games under. You can have multiple players with their own series of saves, which I guess if you‚Äôre sharing your computer with a sibling would be useful to keep your save games separated.</p>

<p>Each save automatically captures the current location, and you can even enter arbitrary notes about the save, which can also be handy.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_055.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The story unfolds over 7 days, with each day starting with a title card. Once you solve the case of the robbery from the pawn shop and realize you may want to get back into sleuthing, you‚Äôll need to get your fax machine fixed so you can maybe get some new cases.</p>

<p>One of the locations you gain access to early on is an electronics store, which seems to always have exactly one item for sale - and that item always ends up being the thing you currently need (how convenient).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_008.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To get into the electronics store though, you‚Äôll need some means to buy things - like a credit card. In your office you‚Äôll find a stack of mail by the front door, which includes an application for a credit card.</p>

<p>Opening the drawers in your office will reveal a pen and an envelope, and combining those three items will create a ‚Äúready-to-mail application‚Äù, which you then just need to drop into a mailbox.</p>

<p>This is how a lot of these item combination puzzles work. There aren‚Äôt really all that many items on any day that you have access to, and it‚Äôs fairly obvious how they need to be used.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_043.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Whenever you go to the electronics shop, if there‚Äôs an item for sale, you‚Äôre going to need it - and it‚Äôs only a credit card swipe away. I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs no limit on the card, but you only need to use it a handful of times in this one store in the game where you have the power to buy anything.</p>

<p>Navigating the dialogue options properly with the electronics store owner is required on one of the later days, as you‚Äôll need him to spill some info about the security system he just installed at the Knickerbocker hotel.</p>

<p>If you don‚Äôt pick the right options, he‚Äôll end the conversation early. Since there are only 3 options available for each conversation you have, it‚Äôs worth testing all variations with all characters just in case.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_028.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>During conversations with characters, you can also ask about various keywords. Not all characters will know about a all keywords, but this is how you advance your investigation.</p>

<p>You‚Äôll also learn new keywords as you progress, and will need to backtrack to ask all characters about these to see if they can shed any light on the topic.</p>

<p><em>Under a Killing Moon</em> does a great job of making this game world feel large and expansive, but there actually aren‚Äôt that many locations to visit or characters to interact with.</p>

<p>The balance they strike though of forcing you to backtrack without making it feel tedious is impressive.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_022.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Some characters you interact with are mutants, and may be disfigured. I know that earlier games go into more detail about what happened in the world for this to happen, but here they don‚Äôt really explore this very much.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://texmurphy.fandom.com/wiki/Under_a_Killing_Moon">some additional context</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some people have developed a natural resistance against radioactivity, and thus are normal or ‚ÄúNorms‚Äù ‚Äì everybody else are Mutants in some form. Tensions between the two groups have risen dramatically since the end of the war, and Norms and Mutants usually do not get along. [‚Ä¶] The Law and Order Party has long since dissolved and disbanded but it still lives on in the more extremist and openly anti - mutant group The Crusade for Genetic Purity which now espouses a return to pre-WWIII society with Norms having full control of society without mutants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can ask characters about the crusade, but most won‚Äôt really give you much information.</p>

<p>I actually really love the backstory of this game and wish they‚Äôd leaned into world building a bit more, but I guess the expectation was you‚Äôd played through the previous games in the the series and were up to speed already.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_052.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As the game progresses you get wrapped up in a plot to eradicate all mutants (and I think humans considered ‚Äúimpure‚Äù) by raining down a virus from an orbiting space station known as the Moon Child.</p>

<p>Your mission then becomes to save Eva (who you learn infiltrated the CAPRICORN corporation‚Äôs cult and was sharing info via videos) from the Moon Child, blow up the station and return to Earth.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_066.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For a game considered the ‚Äúlargest video game ever‚Äù (at 4 CDs), <em>Under a Killing Moon</em> is fairly straightforward to complete.</p>

<p>This being an FMV game from the early 90s means you‚Äôre going to be treated to some questionable voice and character acting, but overall it‚Äôs not too bad.</p>

<p>James Earl Jones‚Äô narrative does a great job of setting the tone of the game, and the brief sequences with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margot_Kidder">Margot Kidder</a> are enjoyable.</p>

<p>Navigating the game world‚Äôs 3D environment from a first person perspective made the exploration portions of the game very engaging, and since most scenes weren‚Äôt that big it didn‚Äôt feel like things were purposely hidden in weird places just to screw with you.</p>

<p>You really feel like you‚Äôre part of the story as it progresses, and the characters (typically) don‚Äôt feel two dimensional. The puzzles aren‚Äôt overly complicated, and though they can be a bit repetitive, don‚Äôt become tedious.</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun playing through <em>Under a Killing Moon</em>, and look forward to one day revisiting this world and its characters in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pandora_Directive">The Pandora Directive</a>, but given the rate at which I play through these games ‚Ä¶ that might take me a while.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scoop_(video_game)">The Scoop</a> is a mystery adventure game published by Telarium, a subsidiary of Spinnaker Software, in 1986 for Apple II and rereleased by Spinnaker Software in 1989 for DOS. The plot is based on the collaborative detective novel of the same name, written in 1931 by Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, E. C. Bentley, Anthony Berkeley, Freeman Wills Crofts, and Clemence Dane.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/scoop/scoop_028.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though I read some Agatha Christie books many years ago, nothing really stuck with me other than vaguely remembering the plot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_on_the_Orient_Express">Murder on the Orient Express</a>. As such, I had no idea what type of game <em>The Scoop</em> was going to be, nor did I have any familiarity with what (or who) the ‚ÄúLondon Detection Club‚Äù was.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You‚Äôre a reporter for the <em>Daily Courier</em>, and you‚Äôre investigating the murder of Geraldine Tracey. If you can solve the mystery in time, you‚Äôll scoop the  <em>Morning Star</em> and win the game. But to get your scoop, it‚Äôs not enough merely to figure out who you think committed the murder. Instead, you must be present when the murderer is confronted by the authorities‚Äìeven if you have to arrange the confrontation yourself!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I started off by giving the <a href="https://www.mocagh.org/spinnaker/scoop-manual.pdf">game manual</a> a quick read, and the introductory blurb does definitely set the stage for the game. You pick you character‚Äôs gender, enter the name you‚Äôd like to be referred to as and get dropped in front of the Daily Courier.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/scoop/scoop_001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In case you didn‚Äôt read the manual, your editor let‚Äôs you know what you need to do once you enter the office and select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SPEAK</code> from the verb list.</p>

<p>As with many adventure games of this era, you interact with the game world using various verbs. The DOS port, which was released 3 years after the Apple II version, improves the interface slightly by greying out verbs that aren‚Äôt currently accessible on a given screen.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/scoop/scoop_008.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The goal of this game is to solve the murder by Saturday, which gives you 5 days of in-game time to do so. Everything you do causes time to pass, and various events will only occur at certain times of the day, on certain days or after certain actions.</p>

<p>If you think there is an action about to occur but you need to kill some time, there‚Äôs even a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WAIT</code> verb you can use.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/scoop/scoop_002.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To try and progress the story and identify the murderer you‚Äôll need to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TRAVEL</code> about the city taking taxis, trains and the bus. At each location there can be many shops, businesses or residences that you‚Äôll find people in that you can question.</p>

<p>You‚Äôll want to ask everyone <em>What‚Äôs on your mind?</em>, and take note, as this is how you‚Äôll learn about the other characters and locations you‚Äôll need to visit and speak to. You can‚Äôt ask about people or visit locations until they‚Äôve been mentioned in conversation, so it‚Äôs pretty important to speak to everyone.</p>

<p>Here as well though, timing is everything and you‚Äôll need to keep track of the time. Characters won‚Äôt always answer questions at certain times, and they have schedules to keep so they might leave mid conversation if they‚Äôre supposed to be somewhere.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/scoop/scoop_003.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When two or more people are in a room, you can <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OBSERVE</code> their interactions to learn a bit about their relationship or gather additional clues. Unfortunately you won‚Äôt always know ahead of time if multiple people will be in a room, or even if they will eventually converge somewhere.</p>

<p>This game is all trial and error, and it‚Äôs pretty easy to make it all the way to Saturday without having gathered enough evidence or made enough progress to finish the game.</p>

<p>If this happens, you either reload an earlier save and keep grinding, or start over and try and be more efficient with you time management.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/scoop/scoop_012.png" alt="" />
<em>Searching before midnight reveals nothing</em></p>

<p>Other than talking to everyone you meet, you‚Äôll also need to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SEARCH</code> every screen to see if there are any clues you can <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TAKE</code>. As with character interactions, searching a location can produce different results at different times of day or on different days.</p>

<p>For example, you can collect the daily paper from the <em>Morning Star</em>‚Äôs presses, but only if it‚Äôs after midnight.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/scoop/scoop_013.png" alt="" />
<em>After midnight and the day‚Äôs paper is available and can be taken</em></p>

<p>You‚Äôre trying to scoop another reporter - which is why the title of the game is <em>The Scoop</em>. This is why it‚Äôs important to get the daily paper as it can give you clues as to how your rival‚Äôs investigation is going, as well as surface locations to visit when you <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EXAMINE</code> the paper.</p>

<p>This is a bit tedious as any time you find something via a search, you need to take it and examine it. There‚Äôs also an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INVENTORY</code> you can scroll through, but it doesn‚Äôt really serve much of a purpose as the examine verb will also give you the same list.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/scoop/scoop_018.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Many times throughout the game you‚Äôll want to search a room, but can‚Äôt as there‚Äôs someone in the room and they‚Äôd catch you. If you wait long enough though, they‚Äôll eventually leave, but this can cost you a lot of time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/scoop/scoop_000.gif" alt="" />
<em><strong>Animated</strong>: wait, then wait, then wait some more and maybe something will happen</em></p>

<p>If you exit a location and wait long enough for the occupant to leave, you may see them jump into a cab. In these situations, you can also hail a cab and try to follow them, but this won‚Äôt always work. I didn‚Äôt actually use this during my playthrough, but it‚Äôs an interesting mechanic.</p>

<p>Taking note of people‚Äôs schedules like this is important, especially if you have to restart because you ran out of time. Knowing character schedules can help you plan your interrogations and investigation more efficiently to avoid having to wast time unnecessarily.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/scoop/scoop_021.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As your searches turn up clues, you‚Äôll be able to show them to characters you‚Äôre interviewing to potentially surface further insights. Every interaction you have with a character takes up about 2 minutes of in-game time, so hammer everyone with questions can sometimes trigger their departure, which can leave you having asked the wrong questions or shown the wrong items and unable to progress.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/scoop/scoop_025.png" alt="" />
<em>I‚Äôm pretty sure I needed that note as evidence</em></p>

<p>Showing the wrong item to the wrong person can also result in you losing that item. When this happens you‚Äôll likely have to restore or restart as this may have been a key item.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/scoop/scoop_027.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Since your goal is to get Inspector Smart to confront the murderer while you are present, you‚Äôll need to make sure you get him clues and information as you uncover them. Assuming all goes well you‚Äôll be able to get this all sorted out before noon on Saturday.</p>

<p>If you aren‚Äôt able to have the Inspector confront the murderer, your editor lets you know you‚Äôve failed, the paper goes bankrupt and you‚Äôre all unemployed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/scoop/scoop_031.png" alt="" />
<em>You solved the case. Good for you!</em></p>

<p>Assuming you are able to solve the case though and get Inspector Smart to the right place at the right time, your editor is proud of you and the game is over.</p>

<p>Honestly, <em>The Scoop</em> isn‚Äôt that bad. There‚Äôs some generic sound effects here and there, but no music anywhere so it‚Äôs a fairly quiet adventure. There are A LOT of characters and locations to visit and engage with in a short period of time, and it‚Äôs very likely you‚Äôll fail and have to restart a few times before you‚Äôre able to identify the murderer.</p>

<p>Overall it‚Äôs a fairly short game, though it can feel a lot bigger than it is with all the backtracking and repetition that‚Äôs required. The time-based mechanic is interesting, but it can be frustrating when you‚Äôre just blindly <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WAIT</code>ing on screens to see if a character might appear or a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SEARCH</code> might produce a different result.</p>

<p>I still enjoy these menu-driven games, but I get that they‚Äôre not for everyone. I did enjoy the story, and the characters felt realized and meaningful to the plot - even if there were too many of them.</p>

<p>Though I wouldn‚Äôt play this again or really recommend it to anyone, I did have some fun playing through it.</p>

In May of 2023 they <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-tcp-socket-api-connect-databases/">announced support for a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">connect()</code> API</a> which allows <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/tcp-sockets/">TCP Sockets</a> to be created within Workers, but is not a direct replacement for Node.js‚Äô <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#class-netsocket"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">net.Socket</code></a> API.</p>

<p>Many NPM packages - including MongoDB‚Äôs <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/">Node.js driver</a> - rely on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">net.Socket</code> or <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#class-tlstlssocket"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tls.TLSSocket</code></a> to connect to and communicate with remote systems. Using these libraries directly from Cloudflare Workers <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/t/cloudflare-workers-integration-is-now-possible/226708/11?u=alexbevi">has not been possible</a> as a result of these missing APIs.</p>

<p>Cloudflare recently announced that <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/more-npm-packages-on-cloudflare-workers-combining-polyfills-and-native-code/">more NPM packages would be supported on Cloudflare Workers</a>, but for libraries that need <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">net.Socket</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tls.TLSocket</code> access, will they work in a Cloudflare Workers environment?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Packages that could not be imported with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nodejs_compat</code>, even as a dependency of another package, will now load. This includes popular packages such as [‚Ä¶] <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongodb</code></strong>, [‚Ä¶] and many more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on the blog post the Node.js driver should load, but can it be used?</p>

<blockquote class="prompt-tip">
  <p>Note that the fact that Workers can load, but not use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongodb</code> package was reported to Cloudflare at <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/6684">https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/6684</a></p>

  <p>The Cloudflare blog post has since been updated to remove <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongod</code> from the list of useable packages to avoid further confusion.</p>

<p>The first time we run our test code however we‚Äôre unable to resolve the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#srv-connection-format">SRV connection format</a> as it appears that <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/dns.html#dnsresolvetxthostname-callback"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dns.resolveTxt</code></a> is not implemented:</p>

<p>Since Atlas allows you to also connect using the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#standard-connection-string-format">standard connection string format</a>, let‚Äôs update the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONGODB_URI</code> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wrangler.toml</code> to instead be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongodb://...</code>:</p>

<p>Based on the above it appears <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#eventsonceemitter-name-options"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">events.once</code></a> is missing, which Node.js‚Äô <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">net</code> module exposes from an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EventEmitter</code> import.

<p>What about trying to configure <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wrangler</code> to connect to a local MongoDB instance (ex: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongodb://localhost:27017</code>)? Well in that case it will still fail, but at least it will fail differently:</p>

<p>If you happen upon the article called <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/cloudflare-worker-rest-api/">‚ÄúCreate a REST API with Cloudflare Workers and MongoDB Atlas‚Äù</a> you may be thinking there‚Äôs an alternate solution to be explored. MongoDB offered a REST-based interface to your data in Atlas via the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/data-api/">Atlas Data API</a>, however this product was recently deprecated and will be sunset.</p>

<p>A custom REST-based API would be a solution to working with your MongoDB data from within Cloudflare Workers, so until the runtime is updated to better support Node.js‚Äô socket APIs, see the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/data-api/data-api-deprecation">Data API deprecation</a> page for some ideas.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.neurelo.com/guides/mongodb-atlas-migrate-rest-data-apis-to-neurelo">Neurelo seems like a good option</a> for getting a REST-based API off the ground with little effort.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Though <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#module-aliasing">module aliasing</a> and polyfills might be an option for some functionality, it really seems like Cloudflare Workers just aren‚Äôt meant to work with Node.js‚Äô socket APIs.

<p>Some work <a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-4785">was proposed</a> by MongoDB‚Äôs team to allow a custom transport layer to be provided, however this would still require Cloudflare Workers to support Node.js‚Äô <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html">TLS</a> API as <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/faq/security/#can-i-disable-tls-on-my-deployment-">TLS cannot, for good reasons, be disabled for Atlas deployments</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="MongoDB" /><category term="mongodb" /><category term="drivers" /><category term="node" /><category term="nodejs" /><category term="javascript" /><category term="typescript" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cloudflare Workers is a great platform for deploying serverless JavaScript code, but has historically never supported raw sockets.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Quest_V">Space Quest V: Roger Wilco ‚Äì The Next Mutation</a> is a graphic adventure game, created by Dynamix, and released by Sierra On-Line for MS-DOS on February 5, 1993. The game is the fifth entry in the Space Quest series, and the first game to be only designed by Mark Crowe. The story, set within a spoof of the Star Trek franchise, focuses on players taking control of Roger Wilco, who achieves his dreams of becoming a star captain but winds up involved in saving the galaxy from a deadly threat posed by a man-made virus.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq5/scummvm-sq5-00012.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After traveling back and forth through time in the previous game, Roger Wilco is back in the Starfleet Academy, serving as both a cadet and a janitor. Cheating his way through the Starfleet Aptitude Test, Roger is finally given the rank of captain, his own ship (a garbage scow) and a mission: to explore strange new worlds (which no man in his right mind would explore), to seek out new life and new civilizations (which grew out of the massive amounts of trash Roger will collect on his way), to boldly go where no man has gone before. Step by step Roger will have to unveil a galaxy-wide biohazardous material dumping scheme, solve the mystery of the disappearance of a fellow Starfleet captain and his ship, and confront an agent of an old nemesis.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq5/scummvm-sq5-00024.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As I work my way through the games I‚Äôve listed on this journey, Space Quest V was one I was more excited to replay as it has a lot of nostalgic value. I can still remember leafing through the <a href="https://www.spacequest.net/sq5/manual/sq5manual.pdf">Galactic Inquirer</a> that came with the game. At that time I would still occasionally go out grocery shopping with my parents and would see the tabloids at the check outs with headlines like <a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/funny-tabloid-headlines/nathandavidson">‚ÄúHalf-Man Half-Dog Baffles Doctors‚Äù</a>, so the format here was immediately appealing.</p>

<p>Not really sure how well this stands up nowadays though‚Ä¶</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq5/scummvm-sq5-00001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The manual gives you a couple pointers on how to get started on your adventure, including getting to your classroom and cheating on the StarCon Aptitude Test. Once you sit down and start taking the test, there is a robot monitoring everyone to make sure no one‚Äôs cheating - so clearly the goal here is to cheat.</p>

<p>Roger can peer over to see the answers of the students to either side of him. If he gets caught, he‚Äôll be ejected from the academy (into space) and it‚Äôs game over. If you copy from the wrong student you‚Äôll get the wrong answers, so make sure you pick the smart kid to cheat off of (hint: the one with the big brain).</p>

<p>When you select the right student you‚Äôll hear the tone play that indicates your score has gone up. This is a sure fire way to confirm you‚Äôve done something correctly that will advance the plot or direction of the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq5/scummvm-sq5-00009.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game is a mashup of all your favourite sci-fi properties such as Star Trek, Star Wars and Alien. Early on you‚Äôll meet a critter on the shape that looks a lot like a <a href="https://avp.fandom.com/wiki/Facehugger">facehugger</a> from Alien. Instead of it killing you right away though, Roger thinks he looks cute, names him Spike and keeps him as a pet.</p>

<p>Many story sequences are presented in this comic book panel style and it‚Äôs clear a lot of effort went into the artwork for this game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq5/scummvm-sq5-00002.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For game from 1993 you‚Äôre getting some of the best VGA graphics sprite-based artists could crank out. The character models are extremely expressive, the background artwork is detailed and there‚Äôs plenty of sight gags and hidden details to discover on each screen that immerses you in the experience.</p>

<p>Space Quest games never take themselves too seriously, and Space Quest V is no exception. I really enjoy clicking the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code> action on as much as I can on each screen as the feedback you get tends to be witty or funny.</p>

<p>When Roger does something stupid, the sound effect they chose was Homer Simpson‚Äôs ‚ÄúDOH!‚Äù, which just feels weirdly appropriate for this game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq5/scummvm-sq5-00030.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There is no voice acting, and many scenes don‚Äôt have background music - just some looping background noise. When on the deck of your garbage scow the sound effects are what you‚Äôd expect to hear on the deck of the starship Enterprise.</p>

<p>When you do get music in a scene it tends to help build tension or reinforce that something significant is about to happen, but it is used sparingly which can make some scenes feel a bit empty.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq5/scummvm-sq5-00025.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you‚Äôve played any of the Space Quest games you know that Roger Wilco is a bit of a tool, and sort of bumbles his way into situations he doesn‚Äôt belong in. For this installment in the series, he accidentally gets a perfect score on his StarCon Aptitude test and gets assigned to a starship as a captain.</p>

<p>This starship is actually a garbage scow - which is appropriate seeing as you‚Äôre a janitor. You‚Äôll have to fly to various locations to pick up garbage in space as you wait for instructions or story elements to unfold that direct you to your next location.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq5/scummvm-sq5-00008.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Initially you have 3 crew members, and you issue commands through various menus you can access from your control panel (click a coloured button to bring these up, or speak the crew members directly using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">COMMAND</code> icon).</p>

<p>This is a bit more involved than previous games, but it ends up being fairly straightforward. You‚Äôll need the Galactic Inquirer for the star codes to various planets (this is the copy protection), and the commands you issue are usually the same:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lay in a course</li>
  <li>go to light speed</li>
  <li>wait to arrive</li>
  <li>go to regular speed</li>
  <li>orbit planet</li>
  <li>activate RSS</li>
</ul>

<p>This will suck up the space trash and allow you to proceed with the story.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq5/scummvm-sq5-00036.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Like all good Sierra games of this era, there are many ways to get yourself killed. The Space Quest series always tends to have the best game over screens, so it‚Äôs worth experimenting a bit to see how Roger‚Äôs untimely end can be met in various scenarios.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq5/scummvm-sq5-00014.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Also, like many Sierra games at the time, Space Quest V contains an unrelated mini-game that acts as filler. Instead of having to play poker like in <a href="/blog/2022/03/15/police-quest-1/">Police Quest: In Pursuit of the Death Angel</a>, or that stupid card game in <a href="/blog/2024/03/20/codename-iceman/">Codename: ICEMAN (Sierra On-Line)</a> ‚Ä¶ this time you play something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)">Battleship</a>.</p>

<p>Seeing as you can <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/savescum">savescum</a> your way to victory pretty easily, there‚Äôs not much challenge here. It is a decent distraction and can be fun for a few minutes, so I appreciate the fact that it was included.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq5/scummvm-sq5-00033.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There is some variety to the gameplay, and at one point you are teleported down to a planet at the same time as a fly and end up having your genes spliced with the insect. Playing as a fly, you have to solve a couple of puzzles to get your body back while also advancing the story.</p>

<p>Being a fly allows you to crawl through a security card reader to gain access to a building that you‚Äôd typically need a card for. By crawling through the beams and observing which ones activate locking mechanisms, you‚Äôll later be able to punch a card to recreate the access card.</p>

<p>I remember really finding this puzzle clever when I originally played this game as it wasn‚Äôt overly complicated, and knowing I had a business card and a hole punch in my inventory it sort of made sense what I was going to have to do.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq5/scummvm-sq5-00028.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Not all the puzzles are fun though. When Cliffy (your chief engineer) gets himself ejected from the ship and you need to go rescue him it typically takes a few tries to navigate the awkward controls before you run out of fuel or oxygen.</p>

<p>Since I play these games on max speed, turning this down about 50% actually made the sequence a lot easier to complete.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq5/scummvm-sq5-00022.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As I‚Äôm writing this review and going back over my screenshots, it seems arcade sequences are actually more prominent that I remembered. This is potentially the result of Dynamix developing the game - not Sierra.</p>

<p>An interesting piece of trivia is that Dynamix originally developed the demo for Space Quest V using their <a href="https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/DGDS">DGDS game engine</a>, but for the final game Sierra‚Äôs <a href="https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/SCI">SCI engine</a> was used.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq5/scummvm-sq5-00037.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The only real gripe I had with the game was the maze at the very end. I just really dislike mazes - unless I‚Äôm playing a CRPG that is.</p>

<p>Navigating this maze is just a pain in the ass, but thankfully it‚Äôs fairly short and you can burn through the entire sequence in about 10 minutes. If you happen to pop out under the elevator incorrectly and try to climb you will be crushed to death and get to enjoy one of the many death screens this game has to offer ‚Ä¶ so that‚Äôs something I guess.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq5/scummvm-sq5-00044.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Unlike most (all?) Sierra games, Space Quest V includes product placement in the form of the Sprint logo being displayed after every video call you make. I didn‚Äôt find this to be overly intrusive, but it was kind of odd for an adventure game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq5/scummvm-sq5-00043.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The nostalgia factor on this game is pretty high for me, which is definitely reflected in the higher <em>Replayability</em> and <em>Bonus / Surprise</em> categories. I love the characters and the unapologetic parody at every turn - even if the plot is kind of thin.</p>

<p>I actually tried the <a href="https://archive.org/details/SpaceQuestVTheNextMutationDemo">demo</a> in DOSBox just to see what the difference was, and surprisingly it looked almost identical to the final version of the game.</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun replaying Space Quest V and would highly recommend this title to anyone getting into the genre. It‚Äôs pretty accessible, easy to get into and full of great writing - and puns - lots and lots of puns.</p>

  <p>MongoDB issued the alert titled <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/resources/products/alerts/potential-data-integrity-issues-sep-2024">‚ÄúNode.js v22.7.0 runtime defect can lead to data encoding issues‚Äù</a> on September 10, 2024
If you need detection or remediation scripts, you can find them there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Within days of the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v22.7.0">Node v22.7.0 release</a>, users were already reporting that UTF-8 <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/54543">encodings were broken</a>. The issue results from the introduction of an incorrect optimization for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">buffer.write</code> which can result in strings being encoded using ISO-8859-1 rather than UTF-8.</p>

<p>Though the use of the fast API for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">buffer.write</code> <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/54565">will be disabled</a> with Node v22.8.0, developers using MongoDB‚Äôs Node.js driver could experience data corruption with Node v22.7.0.</p>

<h2 id="mitigating-the-issue">Mitigating the Issue</h2>

<p>To avoid the possibility of data corruption due to this bug it is recommended that Node v22.7.0 <strong>is not used at all.</strong></p>

<p>MongoDB recommends only using Node runtime versions <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/compatibility/#language-compatibility">documented as compatible</a> in production environments. At the time of writing, Node v22.x is not considered a compatible runtime for use with the MongoDB Node.js driver.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-occurs">How it Occurs</h2>

<p>To illustrate how this can occur, consider the following reproduction:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongoid/current/">Mongoid</a> is an object document mapper (like an ORM) built on the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/ruby-driver/current/">MongoDB Ruby driver</a> that Ruby on Rails developers use to interact with their MongoDB data through model instances. When developers choose to <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongoid/current/reference/associations/#cascading-callbacks">cascade callbacks</a>, if their document has a large number of <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongoid/current/reference/associations/#embedded-associations">embedded documents</a>, they might encounter a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SystemStackError</code>. In this article, we walk through how we used <a href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Fiber.html">Fibers</a> ‚Äî a lightweight thread primitive ‚Äî in a non-concurrency related context of recursion to address this issue!</p>

<h2 id="background"><strong>Background</strong></h2>

<p>MongoDB is a document database that‚Äôs designed for scalability, flexibility, and high availability. It‚Äôs a non-relational database that uses JSON-like documents to store data.</p>

<p>Using Mongoid, Ruby on Rails developers working with MongoDB can leverage <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html">ActiveRecord</a>-like referential associations as well as a directly embeddable variation known as embedded associations. Let‚Äôs first explore one type of document: embedded documents.</p>

<h3 id="embedded-documents"><strong>Embedded documents</strong></h3>

<p>Developers can store related data together by <em>embedding</em> these documents in their parent model. This enables them to retrieve the associated data in a single query.</p>

<p>In our example we will use throughout the article, we define a Parent class, a Child class, and a Grandchild class that contain embedded associations. First, we will create a parent document that <em>embeds</em> two children documents with the first child, <em>embedding</em> two grandchildren documents.</p>

<p>The document representation in MongoDB would look something like this:</p>

<p>Now, let‚Äôs say that every time the parent document is saved, we want to perform some logic on the parent document before, after, and around the save operation. An example of this would be logging the beginning of the operation, calculating and storing the time taken by the save operation, and logging the end of the operation. How exactly can we <em>hook</em> into this stage of the document lifecycle?</p>

<h3 id="callbacks"><strong>Callbacks</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Callbacks</strong>, in the context of a Mongoid application, are hooks into the lifecycle of a document‚Äôs persistence context. These hooks enable developers to perform logic before, after, and/or around (immediately before and immediately after) document lifecycle events like validate, create, update, save, and destroy.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs modify our Example base class definition to include hooks into the before, after, and around events of the document‚Äôs <em>‚Äúsave‚Äù</em> lifecycle.</p>

<p>Mongoid depends on <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_callbacks.html">ActiveRecord‚Äôs callbacks</a> implementation, with the relevant API for executing callbacks being <a href="https://www.rubydoc.info/github/mongoid/mongoid/Mongoid%2FInterceptable:run_callbacks"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mongoid::Interceptable#run_callbacks</code></a>. In our example, when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run_callbacks</code> is triggered, it will execute the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">before_save</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">around_save</code> callbacks around the execution of the save operation, followed by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">after_save</code> callback.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yield</code> keyword in Ruby used when executing around callbacks is key.</p>

<p>Given that embedded documents are often used to store related data, sometimes, we may want the callbacks of embedded documents to run whenever a persistence operation is performed on the parent document. This phenomenon is known as <strong>cascading callbacks.</strong></p>

<p>üí° <strong>Illustration to build intuition:</strong></p>

<p>To illustrate how the callbacks <em>cascade</em> through the embedded documents, when we run the sample code above, the call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">parent.save</code> would produce the following output:</p>

<p><img src="/images/adviti-01.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Having gained a better understanding of how callbacks cascade for embedded documents, we will now work on the implementation for the same. The task of running callbacks on embedded documents is abstracted away in a private API called <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongoid/blob/v9.0.0/lib/mongoid/interceptable.rb#L161-L187"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mongoid::Interceptable#_mongoid_run_child_callbacks_with_around</code></a> and will be the function we will be working with moving forward.</p>

<h2 id="existing-implementation-mongoid-900-and-earlier"><strong>Existing implementation (Mongoid 9.0.0 and earlier)</strong></h2>

<p>Before we start coding, let‚Äôs first set some goals for our implementation and enumerate what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_mongoid_run_child_callbacks_with_around</code> needs to know:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If an around callback is defined, execution needs to pause at yield and resume after the yielded logic is done executing.</li>
  <li>All cascadable embedded documents need to have their callbacks executed.</li>
</ol>

<p>The implementation must also be elegant, readable, and simple to reason about so that working with it feels good (like <a href="https://www.artima.com/articles/the-philosophy-of-ruby">Matz tells us working with Ruby should</a>).</p>

<p>Next, let‚Äôs dive into the parameters <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_mongoid_run_child_callbacks_with_around</code> expects:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kind</code>: the kind of callbacks to run (e.g., save, create, validate, etc.)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">children</code>: the list of embedded documents to run the callbacks on</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">block</code>: executes the persistence operation the callbacks are being run for; this can either happen directly or after running any other callbacks</li>
</ol>

<p>Equipped with this, we will first analyze the <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongoid/blob/v9.0.0/lib/mongoid/interceptable.rb#L161-L187">old recursive implementation</a>:</p>

<p>This function handles three cases:</p>

<ol>
  <li>There are zero embedded documents (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">child.nil?</code>), and if a code block was provided, it will be run.</li>
  <li>There is one embedded document (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tail.empty?</code>) and its <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongoid/blob/v9.0.0/lib/mongoid/interceptable.rb#L113-L143"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run_callbacks</code></a> function will be invoked.</li>
  <li>There are more than one embedded documents, at which point <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run_callbacks</code> will be called recursively.</li>
</ol>

<p>This recursive use case is where we can get into trouble. If we dig into the logic, it appears that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run_callbacks</code> yields to the custom block passed in that invokes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_mongoid_run_child_callbacks_with_around</code> but with the parameter for children as the list of remaining documents (stored in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tail</code>).</p>

<p>This seems intuitive as well based on colorized output (see above), where each color corresponds to one invocation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_mongoid_run_child_callbacks_with_around</code>.</p>

<p>To better understand how this recursive implementation can become problematic, let‚Äôs adjust the number of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Child</code> embedded documents our sample code will generate:</p>

<p><strong>So, how did the stack space get exhausted?!</strong></p>

<p>Well, in the general case, an invocation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_mongoid_run_child_callbacks_with_around</code> creates a stack frame for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run_callbacks</code>. When <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run_callbacks</code> eventually yields to the block passed in, this block creates a stack frame for running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_mongoid_run_child_callbacks_with_around</code> and so on.</p>

<p>As a result, there is at least one extra stack frame for every invocation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_mongoid_run_child_callbacks_with_around</code> which corresponds directly to the number of embedded documents, eventually reaching a depth that results in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SystemStackError</code> being raised. The number of callbacks that can be added to the stack can vary from system to system, which makes it challenging to optimize the existing approach consistently.</p>

<p>Maybe there‚Äôs a better way to approach this ‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="replacing-recursion-with-fibers-in-mongoid-901"><strong>Replacing recursion with fibers in Mongoid 9.0.1</strong></h2>

<h3 id="so-what-even-are-fibers"><strong>So, what even are fibers?</strong></h3>

<p>Fibers are thread primitives that are used for implementing lightweight cooperative concurrency. These are the two methods we will be using from the Fiber API:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <a href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Fiber.html#method-i-resume"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fiber#resume</code></a> method starts/resumes running the fiber.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Fiber.html#method-c-yield"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fiber.yield</code></a> method is called from within the fiber to return control to the caller of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fiber#resume</code>. These two methods equip fibers with a feature that we will leverage. We can control the scheduling (unlike threads that are scheduled by the operating system).</li>
</ol>

<p>Fibers are typically used in concurrent contexts. However, we thought of using these two methods to somehow run callbacks based on a <a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/secure/attachment/480870/fiber-callbacks-exploration.rb">proof of concept</a> initially proposed by my mentor, <a href="https://github.com/jamis">Jamis Buck</a>!</p>

<h3 id="approach"><strong>Approach</strong></h3>

<p>To investigate this, I wanted to first answer these high-level questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Bottom-up</strong>: How do callbacks work at the level of ActiveSupport in Ruby on Rails through <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CallbackSequence</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CallTemplate</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Filters</code>, all the way up to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run_callbacks</code>?</li>
  <li><strong>Top-down</strong>: How does Mongoid identify a persistence operation, obtain a list of the embedded documents that callbacks can be cascaded to, and cascade the right callbacks for all of them using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run_callback</code>?</li>
  <li><strong>Middle-layer</strong>: At what point within the entire flow of callbacks (discovered through one and two) can fibers be used correctly?</li>
</ol>

<p>I spent the first few weeks of my internship understanding callbacks in the context of the holy trinity: Ruby on Rails, Mongoid, and fibers from the Ruby language. However, when my dreams started running on separate fibers that kept yielding to each other, I realized I had to touch some grass. It was when I was touching grass on a hike that I had my eureka moment ‚Äî ironically inspired by recursion.</p>

<p>In the Programming and Data Structure class I TA‚Äôd, one mantra we would emphasize in the recursion unit was: <em>‚ÄúTake the recursive leap of faith.‚Äù</em></p>

<p>The recursive leap of faith means:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Trust that the function you are implementing runs perfectly and returns the right value.</li>
  <li>Solely focus on figuring out how to depend on the function.</li>
</ol>

<p>Extrapolate this philosophy of trust to this project where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_mongoid_run_child_callbacks_with_around</code> depends on Ruby on Rails‚Äô ActiveSupport:</p>

<blockquote class="prompt-info">
  <p><strong>What if we trust that Ruby on Rails‚Äô handling of callbacks is incredibly efficient and solely focus on <em>how</em> we depend on Ruby on Rails‚Äô <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run_callbacks</code> instead?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This helped us answer Question 3 above: At what point within the entire flow of callbacks can fibers be used correctly? Within <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_mongoid_run_child_callbacks_with_around</code> itself!</p>

<p>The fundamental idea underpinning the solution that I discovered is leveraging fibers in a <em>‚Äúhand-off‚Äù</em> fashion.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fibers.each(&amp;:resume)</code> line runs the fiber for the 0th child. ‚ÄúFiber for 0 does work (begin)‚Äù gets printed. When execution hits the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fiber.yield</code> statement, control is returned to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fibers.each(&amp;:resume)</code>. This then runs the fiber for the next child. In this fashion, the work <em>‚Äúbefore‚Äù</em> the yield gets executed for all the children.</p>

<p>Now, the actual <em>‚Äúwork‚Äù</em> can take place. Thus, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">block&amp;.call</code> runs.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fibers.reverse.each(&amp;:resume)</code> line runs the fiber for the last child. <em>‚ÄúFiber for 1 does work (end)‚Äù</em> gets printed. This then runs the fiber for the second-to-last child. In this fashion, the work <em>‚Äúafter‚Äù</em> the yield gets executed for all the children.</p>

<p>Does this flow seem familiar? It is a linearized version of the bottleneck in the recursive call stack from the implementation in Mongoid 9.0 (and earlier)!</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fibers.each(&amp;:resume)</code> mimics running the before callback and the part of the around callback before the yield.</li>
  <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">block&amp;.call</code> mimics running the block passed in.</li>
  <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fibers.reverse.each(&amp;:resume)</code> mimics the <em>‚Äúunfolding‚Äù</em> of the recursive algorithm by running the part of the around callback after the yield and the after callback.</li>
</ul>

<p>Isn‚Äôt this cool? Together, we have linearized the recursive call stack using a thread primitive!</p>

<p>In our case, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run_callbacks</code> does all the work we illustrated in the code block. To effectively hand off control between the fibers, the one tweak we need to make is that the block we pass into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run_callbacks</code> should yield the fiber.</p>

<p>The solution that we arrived at looks like:</p>

<p>Yay! Let‚Äôs now analyze how the two implementations fair for correctness and efficiency:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>If an around callback is defined, execution needs to pause at yield and resume after the yielded logic is done executing.</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Recursive implementation</em>: Stack frames remember where to resume execution.</li>
    <li><em>Fiber-based implementation</em>: Each fiber resumes execution from the point it yielded.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>All cascadable embedded documents need to have their callbacks executed.</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Recursive implementation</em>: A stack frame is created for each embedded document.</li>
    <li><em>Fiber-based implementation</em>: A fiber is created for each embedded document within one stack frame.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>As demonstrated previously, the recursive implementation stops working for embedded documents in the hundreds. On the other hand, the fibers implementation works for even 10,000+ embedded documents. Thus, you don‚Äôt need to worry about your application working or not working depending on the data you have (although, you should ideally not design your database to have tens of thousands of embedded documents).</p>

<p>The Fiber-based implementation we‚Äôve discussed throughout this post was released in <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongoid/releases/tag/v9.0.1">Mongoid 9.0.1</a> if you want to go check it out. If you‚Äôre unsure how to get started with Mongoid, there are tutorials for <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongoid/current/tutorials/getting-started-rails7/">Ruby on Rails</a> and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongoid/current/tutorials/getting-started-sinatra/">Sinatra</a> that can help start you on your journey to building something amazing with MongoDB and Ruby!</p>]]></content><author><name>Adviti Mishra</name></author><category term="Programming" /><category term="ruby" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linearize a Recursive Call Stack Using Thread Primitives]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.alexbevi.com/images/ruby-banner-2.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.alexbevi.com/images/ruby-banner-2.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
