Previously, these tools were released alongside the MongoDB Server and used matching versioning. If you use mongodump to backup your data using these newer versions, if you try to use an older (pre-4.4) version of mongoresto... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Performance Profiling a Mongoid Issue Using AppProfiler</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/09/09/performance-profiling-a-mongoid-issue-using-appprofiler/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Performance Profiling a Mongoid Issue Using AppProfiler" /><published>2022-09-09T06:41:01-04:00</published> <updated>2022-09-15T07:14:18-04:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/09/09/performance-profiling-a-mongoid-issue-using-appprofiler/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/09/09/performance-profiling-a-mongoid-issue-using-appprofiler/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="Ruby" /> <summary> In MONGOID-4889 the claim was made that assignment of a large number of embedded documents to an instance of a model will take increasingly longer as the size of the list of documents to embed grows. This is notable as no database operations are being performed during this process, which points to potential issues with the library itself.

At that time I’d make ad-hoc changes to my development database, export my table/function/stored procedure/view definitions to text files and check them into source control with any code changes. Using diff functionality I’d compare the schema changes that the DBAs needed to apply to production and we’d script that out separately... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>My Blog is FINALLY PROFITABLE!</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/08/04/my-blog-is-finally-profitable/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My Blog is FINALLY PROFITABLE!" /><published>2022-08-04T08:42:24-04:00</published> <updated>2022-08-18T11:26:09-04:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/08/04/my-blog-is-finally-profitable/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/08/04/my-blog-is-finally-profitable/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="Personal" /> <summary> I signed up for Google AdSense in January of 2015 in hopes of subsidizing some of the time I spent writing with ad-based revenue. Without doing any research I quickly formed some baseless expectations of success and profitability that would see my sparsely populated, personal blog be a vehicle to financial freedom!
