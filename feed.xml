<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codename:_ICEMAN">Codename: ICEMAN</a> is a graphical adventure game made with the SCI engine and published by the American computer game company Sierra On-Line in 1990. The lead designer was Jim Walls, who also created several Police Quest games.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iceman/scummvm-iceman-00001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In the beginning of the 21st century, Earth is experiencing a global oil shortage. Surprisingly, Tunisia remains one of the few countries still in possession of large quantities of high-quality oil. USA and Soviet governments race each other in their attempts to purchase as much oil as possible. Finally, the Soviets take a step further and kidnap the US ambassador, hoping to provoke an international incident. Naval Officer Johnny Westland is sent to Tunisia with the order of rescuing the ambassador and preventing further escalation of the conflict.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iceman/scummvm-iceman-00014.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Code-Name: Iceman is primarily an adventure game similar to Sierra’s other works in that genre. The player navigates the protagonist in eight different directions from third-person view, and types text commands to interact with the environment. The command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code> may be typed separately and lead to different text descriptions depending on where on screen the protagonist is positioned. The game is similar to Police Quest series in that it relies on realistic procedures, in this case military instructions, first aid, etc. The player may reach dead ends and resort to restoring an earlier save if some of these procedures are not followed properly. In addition, a considerable portion of the game consists of submarine simulation, requiring the player to navigate a submarine and fight enemy craft.<sup id="fnref:1:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iceman/scummvm-iceman-00034.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I am a huge fan of the Police Quest series, and I had high expectations for this game since it was also designed by Jim Walls. The EGA artwork is beautiful and the text parser is very forgiving when you’re trying to describe how you want to interact with the current scene.</p>

<p>Like other text parser games you need to type out every command, so if you want to pick something up you need to move Johnny close to the desired object and type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PICK UP</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iceman/scummvm-iceman-00003.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you leave the first screen and venture off to the left you’ll meet a bunch of people and ask to join their volleyball game. The ball floats off and someone goes in after it … and then almost drowns.</p>

<p>At this point you’re introduced to the first of many many many sequences in this game that rely heavily on following documented procedures laid out in the game’s <a href="https://www.mocagh.org/sierra/iceman-manual.pdf">manual</a>.</p>

<p>You need to perform CPR to save the girl that almost drowned, but this (like so many other parts of this game) needs to be done “by the book”.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iceman/scummvm-iceman-00017.png" alt="" />
<em>Make sure you actually read the manual before playing this game</em></p>

<p>The story progresses and you’re called back to active duty. There’s been a kidnapping and you need to make your way to Tunisia to rescue the ambassador, which you’ll be responsible for aboard your nuclear submarine.</p>

<p>Though teh story is interesting and definitely held my attention, I have no idea who the actual intended audience for this game was supposed to be. Nothing you do in this game is intuitive, and almost every game mechanic and sequence will require referring back to the manual.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iceman/scummvm-iceman-00036.png" alt="" />
<em>You’ll refer back to this item several times during the game</em></p>

<p>I’m not sure if it’s copy protection or not, but you find a code book in the game that you need to use to decipher messages the radio operator on the sub gives you. For example he might say something like <em>“Washington: FI-D-B J-C-D”</em>, which you then use the code book to translate too <em>17-4-8 9-6-4</em>. You then refer to page X, row Y, word Z in the manual accordingly to get the word pair <em>OCEAN RUSSIAN</em>, which you type into the computer in your room to hopefully get the right message to progress with the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iceman/scummvm-iceman-00030.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you follow procedure and inspect the equipment properly at some point before encountering an enemy ship you’ll be able to fix a broken cylinder, which you’ll have to properly machine first. This requires selecting the right dimensions from a series of prompts to ensure you’ve got everything “just right” before trying to fix the torpedo launch assembly (I think).</p>

<p>If you don’t do this just right you can’t engage enemies and you’ll die when you get to that sequence.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iceman/scummvm-iceman-00042.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Expect to die often in this game. I’ve played a lot of Sierra Online games and this playthrough likely had the most deaths I’ve ever experienced.</p>

<p>It’s not only because the game is hard, it’s that it’s tedious and the expectation that you’re following instructions perfectly at every given moment sets you up for constant failure.</p>

<p>On the plus side you get different (and sometimes entertaining) failure messages, but it’s so easy to die in this game that it artificially inflates the play time by 3x or 4x.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iceman/scummvm-iceman-00026.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There’s one minigame that you must play as you need to win a bottle of rum, but to do this you play a dice game that takes forever to complete. It’s sort of like yahtzee, instead of points you just win rounds - and you need to win many many rounds to proceed.</p>

<p>The game allows you to save and restore twice before the sailor claims you’re cheating and leaves - putting you in an unwinnable state.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iceman/scummvm-iceman-00035.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Since you’re the captain of a nuclear submarine you get to engage in a couple fight sequences throughout the game. You’re armed with a couple different types of torpedoes and decoys which you can use, but your supply is extremely limited so the battles can be extremely challenging.</p>

<p>I almost gave up on this game after the first sequence a I ended up using all my decoys in the first battle and found myself unable to win the second fight without them. I was extremely close to just watching through a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbSp7JOAJpE">longplay video</a> and taking screenshots of their playthrough instead …</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iceman/scummvm-iceman-00044.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you survive the sub battle, use the periscope and make sure to note down the locations of the island and oil rig, remember to pick up explosives in the sub, properly put on the dive gear and swim to the rig correctly without running out of air - you can place the explosives and blow up the rig.</p>

<p>Assuming you make it this far you can then try to gain entry to Tunisia, which also involves an extremely convoluted sequence of steps.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iceman/scummvm-iceman-00045.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Death awaits you at every turn, screen and decision you make and the game will continue to be frustrating and put you in unwinnable situations as you muddle your way through to your CIA contact who gives you her apartment keys where you can find supplies to steal a delivery driver’s clothes and van.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iceman/scummvm-iceman-00048.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you’ve made it this far without a walkthrough, my hat goes off to you because I was basically just playing the game with the walkthrough open at all times. As a result I was able to make it to the end, kill the ambassador’s kidnappers and save him.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iceman/scummvm-iceman-00051.png" alt="" />
<em>Thankfully you can just press F8 to skip this entire sequence and end the game</em></p>

<p>The final sequence involves driving a van up a hill to a helicopter while terrorists chase you. I never made it around the first corner, and likely died a dozen times trying.</p>

<p>If it wasn’t for the fact that the game lets you skip this sequence, I might have finally just said fuck it and moved on at this point - but I didn’t and was able to complete yet another entry in this journey I’ve undertaken.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iceman/scummvm-iceman-00052.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Codename: ICEMAN is not a fun game, and I have no clue who the intended audience for this was. I didn’t really enjoy this experience at all, and found that even using a walkthrough I had a hard time making progress most of the time.</p>

<p>If this were a “sub simulator” title maybe I’d feel a little differently, but it’s an adventure game so my expectation was that you’d be able to explore and discover - but that’s not the case. Keep the manual open - or just use a walkthrough.</p>

<p>Though the music is pretty good, and the story is compelling, the game itself is frustrating and punishing. I can’t imagine anyone actually likes this game and unless you’re a glutton for punishment I wouldn’t recommend it.</p>

<p>A load balancer enhances your application’s scalability, availability, and performance by efficiently distributing traffic across multiple servers based on a number of <a href="https://kemptechnologies.com/load-balancer/load-balancing-algorithms-techniques">algorithms and techniques</a> - but what about your database? MongoDB is a distributed database, but can it be placed behind a load balancer?</p>

<p>Astute readers of MongoDB’s Node.js driver’s <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/tree/main/test#load-balanced"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test</code> README</a> may have noticed at some point that there is mention of a testing methodology for load balancers, and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/t/load-balancing-mongos/247301">as some in the community have found</a> you can find <a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-58502">public <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SERVER</code> tickets</a> that also allude to this functionality existing.</p>

<p>Digging further you’ll find the <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/load-balancers/load-balancers.rst"><em>Load Balancer Support</em></a> specification for MongoDB’s drivers which states <em>“To specify to the driver to operate in load balancing mode, a connection string option of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loadBalanced=true</code> MUST be added to the connection string”</em> … but how do you actually make that work?</p>

<p>In this post we’re going to explore why MongoDB nodes couldn’t previously be placed behind an <a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/layer-4-load-balancing/">L4 load balancer</a>, and what changed in MongoDB 5.3 that may actually make this possible!</p>

<h3 id="replication">Replication</h3>

<p>Coordination of data distribution and ensuring high availability is done via <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/replication/">replication</a>, which requires the cluster to be aware at all times which node is the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/replica-set-members/#primary">primary</a> and which are <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/replica-set-members/#secondaries">secondaries</a>.</p>

<p>As there can only be one primary, any application targeting the cluster will need to be aware of the current topology as well, as trying to write to a secondary will fail:</p>

<p>All official MongoDB drivers implement the <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-discovery-and-monitoring.rst"><em>Server Discovery and Monitoring</em></a> specification to ensure applications can route requests to the appropriate servers (as outlined in the <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-selection/server-selection.md"><em>Server Selection</em></a> specification). When you have a single application instance with a single connection pool (as outlined in the <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/connection-monitoring-and-pooling/connection-monitoring-and-pooling.md"><em>Connection Monitoring and Pooling</em></a> specification) the number of connections to the cluster is easy to identify, but application deployment configurations can vary and scale.</p>

<p>Thanks to MongoDB drivers all consistently providing connection monitoring and pooling functionality, external connection pooling solutions aren’t required (ex: <a href="https://www.pgpool.net/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page">Pgpool</a>, <a href="https://www.pgbouncer.org/">PgBouncer</a>). This allows applications built using MongoDB drivers to be resilient and scalable out of the box, but based on what we understand regarding <a href="https://alexbevi.com/blog/2023/07/04/how-many-connections-is-my-application-establishing-to-my-mongodb-cluster/">the number of connections applications establish to MongoDB clusters</a> it stands to reason that at a certain point as our application deployments increase, so will our connections.</p>

<p><strong>Can I use a load balancer though?</strong></p>

<p>Due to the need for these additional monitoring connections it has been difficult (impossible?) to place a load balancer between applications and a MongoDB replica set - though adventurous users have developed <a href="https://blog.danman.eu/mongodb-haproxy/">some interesting HAProxy configurations</a> in the past to try and solve this problem. The problem you’d face is that though read requests can be routed to any available server, write requests <em>must</em> target the cluster primary.</p>

<p>For the sake of argument you may ask <em>“what if I had a 100% read workload?”</em>. In that case you <em>could</em> put your hosts behind a load balancer, but you’ll likely run into issues as soon as you try and iterate a cursor (see <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/getMore/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getMore</code></a>). Operations such as <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/find/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find</code></a> or <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/aggregate/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aggregate</code></a> return a cursor (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cursorId</code>) which only exists on the originating server the command targeted. Attempting to execute a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getMore</code> on the wrong server will result in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CursorNotFound</code> error being returned, which can be <a href="https://alexbevi.com/blog/2021/12/29/troubleshooting-mongodb-cursor-xxxxxx-not-found-errors/">challenging to troubleshoot</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sharding">Sharding</h3>

<p>Fortunately, MongoDB already offers a form of “load balancing” for <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/sharding/#sharded-cluster">sharded clusters</a> in the form of the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/sharded-cluster-query-router/">sharded cluster query router</a> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongos</code>).</p>

<p>Assuming the cluster is sharded and if there is more than one <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongos</code> instance in the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/glossary/#std-term-seed-list">connection seed list</a>, the driver determines which <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongos</code> is the “closest” (i.e. the member with the lowest average network round-trip-time) and calculates the latency window by adding the average round-trip-time of this “closest” <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongos</code> instance and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">localThresholdMS</code>. The driver will load balance randomly across the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongos</code> instances that fall within the latency window.</p>

<p><strong>Can I use a load balancer though?</strong></p>

<p>Sharding introduces a routing layer between the application and the cluster members, which slightly simplifies how drivers route operations as there is no longer a need to track replica set state. You may think this would make placing a pool of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongos</code>’ behind a load balancer straightforward, but as Craig Wilson describes in a <a href="http://craiggwilson.com/2013/10/21/load-balanced-mongos/">2013 blog post</a>, similar issues will still arise when trying to iterate cursors. Note that though Craig’s post references the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/legacy-opcodes/">legacy opcodes</a>, the situation would be the same if using newer drivers that leverage <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mongodb-wire-protocol/#std-label-wire-op-msg"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_MSG</code></a> and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mongodb-wire-protocol/#std-label-wire-op-compressed"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_COMPRESSED</code></a>.</p>

<p>Note that the <em>Server Selection</em> specification <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-selection/server-selection.md#cursors">calls out that</a> <em>“Cursor operations […] do not go through the server selection process. Cursor operations must be sent to the original server that received the query […]”</em>. As this state information would not be tracked within the load balancer, issues would arise if a cursor operation were attempted and a balancer returned a different server where the cursor didn’t exist.</p>

<h3 id="operationcount-based-server-selection"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">operationCount</code>-based Server Selection</h3>

<p>As it is a form of “load balancing” it’s worth just calling out that in an effort to alleviate runaway connection creation scenarios (“connection storms”) the drivers <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-selection/server-selection.md#operationcount-based-selection-within-the-latency-window-multi-threaded-or-async">approximate an individual server’s load</a> by tracking the number of concurrent operations that node is processing (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">operationCount</code>) and then routing operations to servers with less load. This should reduce the number of new operations routed towards nodes that are busier and thus increase the number routed towards nodes that are servicing operations faster or are simply less busy.</p>

<h2 id="load-balancer-support">Load Balancer Support</h2>

<p>When you see a ticket called <a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-58207">“Enable Feature flag for Support for Deploying MongoDB behind a L4 Load Balancer”</a> closed out as fixed for MongoDB
6.0.0-rc0 and 5.3.0-rc3 it’s hard not to get excited - but what does this mean? After doing a bit of digging you’ll find that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongos</code>’ now support a proxy protocol which is configured via the <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/r7.0.6/src/mongo/s/mongos_server_parameters.idl#L66-L74"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loadBalancerPort</code></a> startup parameter.</p>

<p>Given that there’s a driver specification, driver implementations (such as for the <a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-3011">Node.js driver</a> and <a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/RUBY-2515">Ruby driver</a>) and server support it should be possible to configure a sharded cluster to utilize the proxy protocol.</p>

<blockquote class="prompt-danger">
  <p>Before we proceed it’s worth calling out that this is not considered an officially supported configuration. Until MongoDB’s server team promotes this as a valid production configuration it should be considered experimental if used with a self-managed deployment.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>

<p>For our test we’ll be configuring a single-shard sharded cluster with 5 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongos</code>’ behind an <a href="https://www.haproxy.org/">HAProxy</a> load balancer. Assuming you’re already familiar with <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-haproxy-and-load-balancing-concepts">HAProxy and load balancing concepts</a>, we’ll be setting up a <a href="https://www.haproxy.com/documentation/haproxy-configuration-tutorials/load-balancing/tcp/#enable-tcp-mode">TCP proxy</a> to perform <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">roundrobin</code> balancing.</p>

<h4 id="1-setup-a-local-sharded-cluster">1. Setup a local sharded cluster</h4>

<p>First we need a local sharded cluster, which we’ll provision using <a href="https://github.com/aheckmann/m"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m</code> - the MongoDB version manager</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rueckstiess/mtools"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mtools</code></a>.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

mlaunch stop
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This configuration will yield a single <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/sharded-cluster-shards/">shard</a> with 3 nodes, a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/sharded-cluster-config-servers/#replica-set-config-servers">config server replica set</a> and 5 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongos</code>’. Once started, we immediately stop the cluster as some additional (manual) configuration is required.</p>

<h4 id="2-update-the-cluster-configuration-to-enable-proxy-protocol">2. Update the cluster configuration to enable proxy protocol</h4>

<p>Since we need to modify the startup parameters for our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongos</code>’ we’ll update the configuration file that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mlaunch</code> (part of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mtools</code>) uses.</p>

<p>The above commands just append a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/setParameter/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setParameter</code></a> call as a command line option so we can configure the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loadBalancerPort</code> parameter of each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongos</code>. Once completed we restart the cluster.</p>

<h4 id="3-configure-haproxy">3. Configure HAproxy</h4>

<p>As we’re using HAproxy for our test we’ll to build out our custom configuration. The example below will write to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongodb-lb.conf</code> file, which will then be read by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">haproxy</code> to create our load balanced endpoint. I’m not going to go into detail as to what all the options below mean, but if you want to investigate further see <a href="https://www.haproxy.com/documentation/haproxy-configuration-manual/latest/">HAproxy’s configuration manual</a>.</p>

<p>To make monitoring a little easier you’ll notice we’ve enabled <a href="https://www.haproxy.com/blog/exploring-the-haproxy-stats-page">HAProxy’s stats frontend</a>.</p>

<h4 id="4-test-application-connectivity-through-the-load-balancer">4. Test application connectivity through the load balancer</h4>

<p>Since the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/">MongoDB Shell</a> uses the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/">Node.js driver</a> internally we can use to validate if our load balancer is configured properly. We’ve setup HAProxy to listen on port 37000, so we should be able to connect to that directly:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

MongoServerSelectionError: The server is being accessed through a load balancer, but this driver does not have load balancing enabled
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Seems the driver knows we’re trying to connect to a load balancer, but we’re missing an option. This is where the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loadBalanced=true</code> option comes into play. Appending this to our connection string will allow us to run an arbitrary workload successfully:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Success! It is worth noting though that this configuration works for us locally as we have direct control of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongos</code> processes startup parameters.</p>

<blockquote class="prompt-warning">
  <p>If you have a MongoDB Atlas sharded cluster, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongos</code>’ cannot manually be placed behind a load balancer as startup parameter configuration access is not available!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Now that we can successfully connect to our load balanced endpoint it’s worth doing a little chaos testing to see how workloads react. The script I shared previously just loops infinitely inserting documents into a collection - but what happens if we kill one or two <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongos</code> processes?</p>

<p>Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mlaunch</code> I just stopped two of the query routers and waited for a while. The inserts kept on - inserting - so I guess we can consider that a successful test. Note that this is obviously not extensive and should not be taken as a guarantee of any sort, but if this is a configuration that interests you give it a shot and let me know what you find.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EcoQuest:_The_Search_for_Cetus">EcoQuest: The Search for Cetus</a> is an educational adventure designed to teach about the importance of environmental ethics.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/eco1/scummvm-ecoquest-cd-00005.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The player is cast into the role of Adam, the twelve-year-old son of the famous ecologist Noah Greene. One day, his father rescues a dolphin from an abandoned fish net. As Adam becomes more friendly with the creature, he is amazed to discover that the dolphin can talk! Adam finds out that his new friend is Delphineus, the messenger of the whale king Cetus. As a qualified scuba diver, Adam is chosen to venture into the underwater kingdom of animals known as Eluria, and help its inhabitants.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/eco1/scummvm-ecoquest-cd-00022.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>EcoQuest uses Sierra’s <a href="http://sciwiki.sierrahelp.com/index.php/Sierra_Creative_Interpreter#SCI1.1">SCI1.1</a> game engine, so the typical actions are accessible for you to cycle through (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MOVE</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TALK</code>), but unlike any other Sierra title you also have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RECYCLE</code> action available.</p>

<p>As this is effectively an “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_entertainment">Edutainment</a>” title the player is meant to learn as the game progresses, and what Sierra’s trying to teach you seems to be how humans littering and polluting can effect the environment.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/eco1/scummvm-ecoquest-cd-00008.png" alt="" />
<em>All that pollution can’t be good for anything living in the water right?</em></p>

<p>Once you meet Delphineus, figure out how to get the diving gear and make your way out into the ocean the game really begins. Delphineus fills you in on some backstory, including that Cetus - the Great Whale King - is missing.</p>

<p>He’ll take you to the underwater kingdom of Eluria, but first you need to get acclimatized to the two moving around the game world. Unlike most adventure games that take place on land, you’ll be in the water for the vast majority of this game so you get around by swimming.</p>

<p>This is no different from walking other than on certain screens where you can surface, you’ll also be able to dive back down underwater.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/eco1/scummvm-ecoquest-cd-00002.png" alt="" />
<em>You’ll use this bag a lot throughout the game</em></p>

<p>As with most Sierra Online games, there is a point system that rewards you for taking various actions as you progress. In EcoQuest one of the main ways you get points is by recycling garbage.</p>

<p>After picking up the garbage bag on the first screen of the game you’ll have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RECYCLE</code> action available for use, which when clicked on a piece of garbage will instruct Adam to dispose of it.</p>

<p>Recycling adds nothing to the game and is just busywork for the player to get more points, but I’m assuming was Sierra’s way of trying to teach kids to be mindful of the environment.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/eco1/scummvm-ecoquest-cd-00014.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you reach the kingdom of Eluria the main plot points will unfold. First you’ll be introduced to the game’s main antagonist, who appears to be a giant manta ray. He just sort of swims by overhead but Delphineus lets you know this is someone to be afraid of.</p>

<p>Second, you’ll learn there’s a prophecy that a child of man would come and save Eluria. How convenient seeing as that’s exactly what you are …</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/eco1/scummvm-ecoquest-cd-00019.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The artwork in this game is excellent, and really draws you into the game world. Even though EcoQuest is more of a “beginner” adventure, it’s very approachable and has a good enough story to entice you to continue playing.</p>

<p>The music and sound effects aren’t great, but aren’t terrible either. The background music samples are typically short, so if you’re on the same screen for a while trying to solve a puzzle it’s very noticeable how often the samples loop.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/eco1/scummvm-ecoquest-cd-00017.png" alt="" />
<em>In the CD version these interactions are fully voiced</em></p>

<p>If you play the CD version of the game then everything is voice acted, and the voice acting isn’t bad. A number of the characters you’ll meet in Eluria definitely feel like they were inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid_(1989_film)">Disney’s “The Little Mermaid”</a>, and the voice actors leaned into their their depictions of these characters pretty heavily.</p>

<p>Though this can come across as campy, I really enjoyed it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/eco1/scummvm-ecoquest-cd-00020.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As far as gameplay is concerned, most of the game is just basic fetch quests and item combination puzzles. Every screen plays out about the same as you’ll have to (a) talk to someone, (b) pick up a bunch of stuff, (c) maybe recycle some garbage, (d) maybe use some items.</p>

<p>Unlike other Sierra games, EcoQuest is somewhat unique as there are no unwinnable states and I’m fairly certain you also can’t die.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/eco1/scummvm-ecoquest-cd-00003.png" alt="" />
<em>This is the solution to one of the last puzzles in the game</em></p>

<p>The item combination puzzles are a bit more difficult, but the game does a pretty good job of shoving the solution in your face - as long as you’re paying attention.</p>

<p>There are no dead ends and no red herrings, so as long as you pick up everything the solution to most puzzles will be pretty obvious as it will typically involving using something or giving something to someone.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/eco1/scummvm-ecoquest-cd-00012.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To add some variety to the gameplay there are a couple puzzles you’ll need to solve as well. The sliding tile puzzle is a pain in the ass, but if you click the <em>Help</em> button the game will automatically play itself.</p>

<p>Clicking <em>Help</em> repeatedly will just keep sliding the tiles for you until the puzzle is solved, so if like me you really don’t like these types of puzzles you’ll appreciate this type of quality of life feature in the game.</p>

<p>The other puzzle just involves rotating 9 sections of a column in a specific order until they lock into place. This one is pretty straightforward and can be brute forced through trial and error relatively quickly.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/eco1/scummvm-ecoquest-cd-00026.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Near the end of the game you’ll find some radioactive waste that you’ll need to get cleaned up. This is done by floating a transmitter up to the surface to alert a salvage crew as to the location of the waste.</p>

<p>The solution here is an item combination puzzle which the game taught you about on the first screen of the game. Hopefully you were paying attention …</p>

<p>Once you get that cleaned up Delphineus will be captured by the manta ray and you’ll need to save him. You’ll also find Cetus, who appears to have been harpooned by a sunken fishing boat. You’ll need to save him, which will involve cutting the head of the harpoon off from inside his mouth. Good think you found a hacksaw a few screens back.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/eco1/scummvm-ecoquest-cd-00025.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You’ll free Cetus, free Delphineus and get into a showdown with the manta ray. Why the manta ray is evil, or what it’s motivation is to torment the citizens of Eluria aren’t really explained,  but you’re going to have to deal with him to finish the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/eco1/scummvm-ecoquest-cd-00028.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Stabbing the manta ray with a lion fish spine will stun it enough for Cetus to whack it with it’s tail. I think you ultimately kill the manta ray, which seems at odds with the more pacifist messaging throughout this game.</p>

<p>EcoQuest is definitely targeted at a younger player, and it does a good job of holding your hand through most of the game. The end result is that it’s really not all that much fun to play as there’s limited variety to the types of interactions you’ll have with the game world.</p>

<p>The game is also incredibly short, which may also be due to the target audience.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure I played this game briefly around the time it came out and didn’t find it all that engaging or entertaining. My opinion hasn’t changed all that much now that I’ve actually completed the game, but I would recommend playing the CD version if you actually want to try this game as the voice acting definitely enhances the play experience.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvester_(video_game)">Harvester</a> is a 1996 point-and-click adventure game written and directed by Gilbert P. Austin, known for its violent content, cult following, and examination of violence. Players take on the role of Steve Mason, an eighteen-year-old man who awakens in a Midwestern town in 1953 with no memory of who he is and a vague sense he does not belong there. Over the course of the next week, he is coerced or manipulated into performing a series of seemingly mundane tasks with increasingly violent consequences at the behest of “The Order of the Harvest Moon,” a cult-like organization which seems to dominate the town and which promises to reveal the truth about Steve and his presence in Harvest.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/harvester/harvest_044.png" alt="" />
<em>Investigating grisly murders is hungry work for this small town sheriff</em></p>

<p>Similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantasmagoria_(video_game)">Phantasmagoria</a> which came out a year earlier, Harvester is an adventure horror <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-motion_video">FMV</a> game. Having played through a few FMV titles in this series already my expectations for the quality of the acting and pre-rendered cutscenes was immediately very low.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/harvester/harvest_019.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You play the part of Steve Mason, who appears to have amnesia and possibly from the future. Steve is played by Kurt Kistler, who’s acting is not great, but given this is a mid-90s FMV game I would consider his performance acceptable. Kurt’s lack of acting chops is due to this<a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/407927256880345/"> being his first acting gig</a> (he played keyboard in a band previously).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/harvester/harvest_010.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The story is dark and compelling right from the get-go, even if it seems thin and you’re just sort of dropped into this world without any direction. You have free reign to move around the game world, which is split into four quadrants - all of which are accessible.</p>

<p>Hovering over locations will tell you what they are, and clicking on them will take you there instantly. This is preferable to long, drawn out navigation sequences though it might have been nice to have some animation on this screen so it’s not so bland.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/harvester/harvest_008.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Each location you visit will have characters you can interact with, and each interaction will unfold a bit more of the plot and give you more background about the characters, their relationships and the town.</p>

<p>At the center of town is the Lodge, which apparently everyone wants to be a member of and seems to <em>really</em> want you to join as well.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/harvester/harvest_005.png" alt="" />
<em>Mom is a stereotypical 50’s homebody</em></p>

<p>The first characters you’ll meet are your mom and brother. This is where you initially learn how to interact with characters, as well as a bit more about the town of Harvest and the fact that you’re engaged and apparently getting married in a few weeks.</p>

<p>These interactions take the form of typical dialogue tree selections, though there’s always an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OTHER</code> option where you can type anything. Other than typing out the options you can select from the tree, the only time I found this “useful” was to ask Mr. Pottsdam about the <em>“peephole”</em> in the bathroom …</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/harvester/harvest_026.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Stephanie - your future bride - also has amnesia. What a coincidence! Similar to you she has no idea who her “family” is or how she got here, but her dad really wants the two of you to get married because your father owns the local meat processing plant and this guy apparently loves meat.</p>

<p>Your initial interactions with Mr. Pottsdam mention “meat” way too often. Also, of all the voice acting in this game, Mr. Pottsdam’s has to be my favourite.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/harvester/harvest_030.png" alt="" />
<em>They really lean into the gay stereotypes at the fire station</em></p>

<p>The game takes place over the course of several days - typically both day and night. In order to progress through the game you’ll need to complete various tasks to trigger the transition from day to night.</p>

<p>This will include talking to various characters and completing many, many fetch quests.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/harvester/harvest_011.png" alt="" />
<em>This game really wants you to know it’s for a mature audience</em></p>

<p>The puzzles in Harvester vary from very obvious to extremely obtuse. It’s very rare that you’ll be able to complete a puzzle by only fetching a single item. As a result, a good chunk of this game will involve hunting for items, typical inventory management tasks and attempting item combinations.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/harvester/harvest_046.png" alt="" />
<em>The more beat up Steve looks, the closer to a game over you are</em></p>

<p>Unlike typical point and click adventure games, Harvester allows you to use weapons as there are fights in this game. Since you can take damage, you also have a health indicator in your inventory showing how close to death you are.</p>

<p>Though this is sort of an interesting mechanic, it’s not all that useful as you typically won’t know how much damage you can take until it’s too late anyway and you’ve already died.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/harvester/harvest_007.png" alt="" />
<em>Get used to seeing this screen</em></p>

<p>Speaking of death, you will die so very much in this game - typically by either picking the wrong conversation option, waiting too long during a timed sequence or just getting your ass kicked by a monster (though this is mostly later in the game).</p>

<p>As you have access to weapons pretty much throughout the game and you can attack almost every NPC, if you kill most of them you’ll end up in jail - which is another game over scenario.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/harvester/harvest_000.raw1.png" alt="" />
<em>A series of fetch quests or a simple act of murder - what would you pick?</em></p>

<p>You typically have multiple ways to solve a fetch quest (which is what makes up most of the puzzles in the game). Certain scenarios allow you to either finish the quest for the person that requested it, or kill that person and just take the item.</p>

<p>This can be a great way to breeze through longer sections of this game, but be careful as this won’t always work and may land you in jail.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/harvester/harvest_029.png" alt="" />
<em>Your future “father in law” is a piece of shit</em></p>

<p>The subject matter in this game isn’t for the faint of heart. Not only is there a lot of violence and gore, but there are allusions to child molestation and eventually a distraught mother killing herself and her daughter.</p>

<p>Though it might seem a bit excessive, or just there for the “shock factor” it actually does help advance the plot and reinforce the central themes that develop Steve’s character towards the endgame.</p>

<p>It’s hard to review this game without bringing up the fact that the actor playing Steve <a href="https://publicsite.dps.texas.gov/SexOffenderRegistry/Search/Rapsheet?Sid=08470942">got into a bit of trouble</a>, but I don’t think his role in this game was foreshadowing future events in any way.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/harvester/harvest_028.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Your ultimate goal is to gain entry into the lodge, which you can only do after performing a series of fetch quests, robberies and acts of vandalism requested by The Sergeant at Arms - who only communicates with you telepathically for some reason that’s never explained.</p>

<p>As you progress through these quests your interactions with the townspeople gets weirder and weirder. You’ll find that completing the quests results in the people you were stealing from dying as a result of your actions.</p>

<p>It sort of feels like desensitizing Steve to the deaths of these people is maybe the point …</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/harvester/harvest_048.png" alt="" />
<em>Yuppers, that key is hidden inside that guy’s head</em></p>

<p>Once you get into the lodge you’ll have to navigate through three floors of puzzles and monsters. There is A LOT of combat in this area, and typically these just involve you picking one of the melee weapons at your disposal and mashing the left mouse button.</p>

<p>There are some healing items scattered around that you can take if you take too much damage, but realistically this sequence of the game (that is about the last third of the game really) requires saving on every screen and reloading if you take too much damage.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/harvester/harvest_053.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Harvester gives you 25 save slots, and believe me you’ll need all of them for the lodge sequence. Even using a walkthrough I died a hell of a lot.</p>

<p>The first floor isn’t too bad, though some of the puzzles require significant mental gymnastics to solve. Luckily when you enter the lodge all of your inventory items are cleared out so you only need to worry about using and combining the new items you find along the way.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/harvester/harvest_049.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you move deeper and deeper into the lodge you find that each room (called a “Temple”) exists to teach you some sort of “lesson” (or the opposite of what you’d expect to learn). As you wind your way through these rooms up to the final confrontation it turns out you and Stephanie have been trapped in a VR simulation and you’re the only two real people in this world.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/harvester/harvest_055.png" alt="" />
<em>You needed a skull and spinal cord to get into the lodge, and you need the same to get out …</em></p>

<p>The ultimate goal has been to train you to be a serial killer, and your final test is to either kill Stephanie in the simulation so she dies in real life - or marry her in the sim and the two of you die in real life.</p>

<p>You get to choose your own ending here, and since you are able to save the game before making this final selection you have the opportunity to experience both endgames pretty easily.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/harvester/harvest_056.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Honestly, I thought I was going to love this game, and for about the first half of my play through - I did. I liked the setting, I liked the characters, I found the plot was progressing well and I really wanted to know more about the lodge.</p>

<p>The problem was once you get through the first half of the game it sort of seems like they ran out of content to keep the story progressing towards the conclusion. The whole “training you to be a serial killer” plot didn’t really make any sense, and though you can force yourself to see how it fits into the narrative … it’s definitely forced.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/harvester/harvest_043.png" alt="" />
<em>This game goes for shock and gore whenever possible</em></p>

<p>Though this game likely went under that radar for a lot of adventure gamers at the time, there were some very vocal and dedicated fans. For example, if you want to learn a bit more about the misadventures of Kurt Kistler you can check out <a href="https://youtu.be/6koKTUidgPc">“Harvester Show #10: The Pedophile We All Know”</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a fan of adventure horror games and have a soft-spot for FMV titles then Harvester should be right up your alley. If that extremely specific combination of genres doesn’t tickle your fancy though, this game probably isn’t for you.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Quest_III">Space Quest III: The Pirates of Pestulon</a> is a 1989 graphic adventure game by Sierra On-Line, and the third game in the Space Quest series. Players assume the role of Roger Wilco, a lowly space janitor, who becomes involved in rescuing a pair of computer programmers from a sinister video game company. The game received positive reviews from critics, and contributed further to the series’ commercial success for Sierra.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq3/scummvm-sq3-00017.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Narrowly escaping the events of <a href="/blog/2023/02/24/space-quest-2/">Space Quest II: Vohaul’s Revenge</a>, Roger Wilco’s escape pod floats through space. As just another metallic item of junk, it’s soon picked up by an interstellar garbage hauler. Waking up in a pile of trash, quite familiar for this janitor-turned-hero, Roger Wilco must somehow escape. Once given access to the rest of the galaxy, he’ll soon find himself having to avoid a collections cyborg for payments overdue, dealing with the corporate prison of software company Scummsoft, and having to digest the greasy food from the galaxy’s finest hamburger joint.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq3/scummvm-sq3-00022.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Like <a href="/blog/2023/02/21/police-quest-2/">Police Quest II</a> and <a href="/blog/2023/02/01/leisure-suit-larry-2/">Leisure Suit Larry II</a>, Space Quest III uses Sierra’s <a href="http://sciwiki.sierrahelp.com/index.php/Sierra_SCI_Release_List#SCI0_.28late.29">SCI0</a> engine, which requires you to interact with the game world via a text parser. Though you have a mouse cursor ever-present, this really only allows you to move around the screen the same way the arrow keys on the keyboard would.</p>

<p>The text parser allows you to enter noun/verb combinations and experience the results of your request via cheeky feedback from the game. Though this control mechanism may be a bit foreign to modern gamers, it’s incredibly well done in Space Quest III, and you’re encouraged to try <em>everything</em> to as you’ll almost always be rewarded with either a funny or snarky response.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in the internals of the engine I’d highly recommend giving the blog post <a href="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/sci-scripts"><em>“Sierra Creative Interpreter – Scripts”</em></a> a read, as it’s by one of the ScummVM authors (Chris Benshoof	aka. <em>sluicebox</em>) who’s invested heavily in tooling and decompilation of SCI resources and scripts.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq3/scummvm-sq3-00009.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you navigate the game world you’ll be treated to decent sound effects and atmospheric music. The best way to experience the sound effects and music in this game is by emulating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_MT-32">Roland MT-32</a>.</p>

<p>It’s relatively easy to do this in ScummVM if you know where to find the the necessary ROMs to get <a href="https://bmaupin.github.io/wiki/archive/applications/games/scummvm.html#getting-roland-mt-32-emulation-working">MT-32 emulation working</a>. Though you had Adlib and Soundblaster available at the time, MT-32 was just so much better. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NSV8_ItVwc&amp;list=PL_BhbJAAueZS-5vMC4m7jCfxqaWfypLmt">Check out this playlist on YouTube</a> to get a sense of how much better the audio sounded using this device!</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq3/scummvm-sq3-00012.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The first third of the game has you trying to escape from a Terminator-like cyborg that is out to collect on a dept Roger incurred in the previous game. After you find a ship in the initial stage and set a course for Phleebhut, the cyborg follows him there and attempts to hunt him down and capture him.</p>

<p>You’ve only got a limited amount of “time” to figure out how to defeat the cyborg (and steal the invisibility belt that he has). While you try to do this you’ll find myriad ways in which to get yourself killed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq3/scummvm-sq3-00014.png" alt="" />
<em>You know you want to watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN32uIpg538">10 minute video</a> compilation of death scenes from SQ3.</em></p>

<p>Since this is a Sierra game, and death literally awaits you around every corner and on every screen it’s very much appreciated how much effort went into scripting the death sequences. Though I typically spend a disproportionate amount of time dying on purpose playing these games just to see what happens, I think I enjoyed the outcome more than usual with Space Quest III.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq3/scummvm-sq3-00018.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you escape the cyborg, you’ll travel to Monolith Burger. This section is pretty short as all you need to do is order a happy meal (or value meal or something like that), eat it to find a decoder ring - then play the Astro Chicken game. This game can be a pain in the ass as you have to land the falling chicken on the landing pad 10 times in a row without it bouncing off. This may sound easy at first, but timing the deceleration of the chicken while maneuvering it across the screen proved to be a lot more challenging than I expected.</p>

<p>After you succeed (or fail enough times that the game feels sorry for you) you’ll be presented with an encoded message. Lucky for you you just found a decoder ring, which you can use to find a secret message from the programmers of Astro Chicken - the <a href="https://spacequest.fandom.com/wiki/Two_Guys_From_Andromeda">two guys from Andromeda</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq3/scummvm-sq3-00024.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Turns out the two guys are being held captive on Pestulon, which is a moon of Ortega. First you need to navigate to Ortega, disable the shield generator around Pestulon, fly to Pestulon and deal with the pirates. What kind of pirates are we talking about? Well, that would be software pirates!</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq3/scummvm-sq3-00027.png" alt="" />
<em>Not what I expected based on the title of the game</em></p>

<p>Elmo Pug, the leader of the “Pirates of Pestulon” (aka. ScumSoft) abducted the 2 guys to force them to design awful games they can flood the galaxy with. There is definitely some light-hearted jabbing at LucasArts with some of the references here, but that just makes me appreciate the writing of this game even more.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq3/scummvm-sq3-00029.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The final sequence of the game involves a couple of mini games. You first have to defeat Elmo Pug in a rock ‘em sock ‘em robots style battle, then escape on your ship and win a space battle. Though not overly difficult, you can lose during both of these sequences, so make sure you have save games before each begin so you can reload when you inevitably die the first few times.</p>

<p>After the space battle you fly the 2 guys to Earth and land in the parking lot of Sierra Online, where Ken Williams hires the 2 guys to work for him as programmers.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq3/scummvm-sq3-00033.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As I play through these games the main thing I typically look for is narrative strength. The graphics don’t need to be great, the music can be so-so and the input mechanics can be clunky, but if the experience of actually <em>playing through</em> the adventure is enjoyable I’ll rate it a lot higher.</p>

<p>Space Quest III is very short, but the writing is funny and the pacing is good. You don’t really need a walkthrough because every time you die you’ll be presented with a popup that typically (a) makes fun of you for dying and (b) nudges you in the right direction to avoid dying again.</p>

<p>Though I rated <a href="/blog/2021/08/09/space-quest-the-sarien-encounter/">Space Quest: The Sarien Encounter</a> pretty highly, it’s primitive and less accessible than this sequel. If you want to try your hand at a parser-driven adventure game I’d highly recommend Space Quest III.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Willy_Beamish">The Adventures of Willy Beamish</a> is a graphic adventure game developed by Dynamix and published in 1991 by Sierra On-Line. The game pioneered the use of in-game graphics drawn to resemble classic hand-drawn cartoon animation. It was initially released for MS-DOS and the Amiga and was ported to the Sega CD in 1993.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/willy/willy_044.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You play Willy Beamish, an eight-year-old kid who is just trying to get through life without losing his lunch money. But he’ll have to deal with parents, teachers, babysitters, and bratty sisters. The player must solve different puzzles to ensure Willy can progress, get out of trouble and generally avoid ending up grounded.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/willy/willy_030.png" alt="" />
<em>He’s talking about his frog “Horny”</em></p>

<p>The in-game time progresses even if no action is taken. This means many puzzles have to be solved in a certain time frame or rely on being in the right place at the right time. A special aspect of this game is the bar which shows Willy’s relationship with his parents. It gets affected by the way certain situations are resolved, e.g. it increases if Willy refuses to play with his sister, and when it is full they send Willy to a military school and the game is lost.<sup id="fnref:1:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/willy/willy_015.png" alt="" />
<em>If that meter hits “Cadet School” it’s game over … literally</em></p>

<p>Avoiding getting in trouble is pretty easy as decisions in this game are typically made during dialogue tree option selection. Almost every character you interact with will present Willy with an option, and one of those options will be the “wrong” one which effects your <em>Trouble Meter</em>.</p>

<p>This will happen on almost every screen of the game for about the first half of the game, so save early - save often.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/willy/willy_002.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For 1991, this game looks great. The cartoony style really draws you into the game world and gives the characters some emotional depth during conversations. The colours are mostly bright and vibrant and complement the youthful innocence of Willy and his friends. This is in stark contrast to Dynamix’s previous title, <a href="/blog/2023/02/13/rise-of-the-dragon/">Rise of the Dragon</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/willy/willy_008.png" alt="" />
<em>Your mom pawns your sister off on you a lot it seems</em></p>

<p>The story revolves around Willy trying to raise money for his entry fee into the Nintari world tournament (get it - “Nintendo + Atari” - so clever …). The family thinks his dad is about to get a huge promotion, but it turns out he gets laid off instead and they’ll need to live a little leaner until he finds work again. Though Willy can do some odd jobs around the house for money like mowing the lawn, walking the dog or washing the car - he’ll need to do something bigger for the $2500 he needs.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/willy/willy_028.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Willy has a pet frog (named “Horny”) that’s with him throughout the game, and there’s a frog-jumping competition on the second or third day of the game with a convenient grand prize of $2500. Your main goal is to get Horny trained up and entered into the competition so that he can compete.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/willy/willy_029.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The frog jumping competition is one of 2 minigames, though it’s sort of “on rails”. If you figure out that you can feed Horny cola to tweak him out, he’ll win first prize but random drug testing will surface that he was “chemically enhanced” and you’ll lose the game. Otherwise you’ll lose to Turbo Frog - which is what’s supposed to happen anyway - and Horny will escape into the Tootsweet factory to progress the plot.</p>

<p>The minigame here is just a distraction and isn’t really a “game”. It’s just a bit of button mashing between story dumps and isn’t really fun to “play” - it’s just there.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/willy/willy_032.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The secondary plot of the game revolves around the Tootsweet owners trying to take over the city you live in. Willy’s dad will apply for a job as their head of PR and get that, only to be thrown under the bus right away as the fall guy for the company. There’s a plumbers strike going on as well which is causing the water to turn brown, so you’ll need to resolve that as well I guess.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/willy/willy_022.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The inventory screen serves two purposes in this game: item storage and time management. Since there are scripted events that take place on various days you have the option of advancing time here to trigger those events. Honestly once I figured this out I’d just save my game at the beginning of the day and just advance time a bunch to see what triggered when on various screens - then reload and proceed incrementally if I found anything.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/willy/willy_037.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You sort of figure this mechanic out for yourself, as the <a href="https://archive.org/details/AdventuresOfWillyBeamishManual/mode/2up">game manual</a> doesn’t allude to time-based events. Luckily you don’t really need to worry about this as there are only a couple of these events throughout the game, such as Willy having to go to bed at the end of the day.</p>

<p>Timing plays a bigger part in puzzles though as a number of these involve using items or pushing buttons in a specific order within a very short amount of time. This is where I died the most, as there certain puzzle sequences that you need to do extremely quickly or it’s game over.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/willy/willy_041.png" alt="" />
<em>Solve this quickly or the guards will catch you</em></p>

<p>Though frustrating at times, I did appreciate that these “real time” puzzles added a sense of urgency. Typically adventure games would give you infinite time to pick and combine items, select a target and execute some action. Willy generally has a few seconds to react if the puzzle he’s trying to solve involves escaping from a dangerous situation.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/willy/willy_039.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Most puzzles are pretty straightforward, though near the end of the game you’ll need to get a bouncer to leave his post at the door of the bar so you can go in. The solution to this puzzle is extremely convoluted and requires you to call a psychic hotline, record the message, call the bar, ask for the bouncer and play the message. None of this is intuitive, and I’m pretty sure without a walkthrough most people wouldn’t muddle their way through this today.</p>

<p>If you’re playing this game for the first time would you know that “432-SIGN” could be translated to “432-7446”? Remember pay phones? Remember phone numbers that would use the lettering on the numbers to form words? I’m sure they still exist …</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/willy/willy_018.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are maybe a dozen locations you can visit throughout the game, with some only becoming available on later days. You have limited time to explore as time continues to advance, and eventually Willy will have to go home to bed, but I didn’t find myself getting lost or stuck at any point.</p>

<p>Basically you just go to each location, talk to whoever is there, pick up anything that isn’t nailed down and try to use everything on … everything. It’s not always obvious what item combinations are required so there is a lot of trial and error involved.</p>

<p>You’ll also want to right-click multiple times on each item you pick up as some of them have a third function on certain screens.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/willy/willy_045.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Occasionally an item will allow you to shoot or throw it, in which case the cursor will be presented as a target or crosshair. I’m pretty sure this only occurs twice, but if you don’t know this is the case it can be frustrating as you die over and over trying to “use” an item in a situation when you actually need to “shoot” it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/willy/willy_046.png" alt="" />
<em>You win the Nintari championship and call it a day</em></p>

<p>Overall I didn’t really like this game as much as I thought I would. I’m a huge fan of Rise of the Dragon, and I generally like their <a href="https://dynamix.fandom.com/wiki/VCR_Interface">VCR interface</a> they use for their games. The background music is fitting and helps enhance the gameplay, but the story is pretty thin and the pacing of the game is slowed by convoluted puzzles.</p>

<p>I played the original DOS release (not the CD ROM version) so I’m not sure if the voice acting they added made any meaningful difference to the experience. I thought the writing overall was pretty good and the general vibe of the game was “saturday morning cartoon come to life”, which I think is what they were going for.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a goofy game starring a 9 year old kid and his frog, The Adventures of Willy Beamish has you covered. Just be prepared to reach for a walkthrough …</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loom_(video_game)">Loom</a> is a 1990 fantasy-themed graphic adventure game by Lucasfilm Games. The project was led by Brian Moriarty, a former Infocom employee and author of classic text adventures Wishbringer (1985), Trinity (1986), and Beyond Zork (1987). It was the fourth game to use the SCUMM adventure game engine, and the first of those to avoid the verb–object interface introduced in Maniac Mansion.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/loom/scummvm-loom-fm-00028.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Bobbin Threadbare is a young man from the Guild of Weavers. He is outcast from the guild and blamed for the lack of prosperity in recent times, though he does not know why. On his seventeenth birthday he is summoned by the Elders of the guild, who intend to decide his fate. However, shortly thereafter all the inhabitants of the village except Bobbin are turned into swans. Bobbin finds out that he is the child of the Great Loom, found by Lady Cygna, who tried to use the loom’s powers to save the guild. Bobbin’s stepmother Dame Hetchel teaches him the art of weaving magical drafts, and Bobbin embarks on a journey to find the lost flock, and the answers to his questions.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/loom/scummvm-loom-fm-00014.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Loom is an adventure game that sets itself apart from other titles in the genre through its unique gameplay system: the player character does not carry items around, but rather manipulates objects through the use of spells (called “drafts” in the game). The drafts themselves are woven by playing magical notes on a special instrument called “distaff”. All the puzzles in the game are solved by learning and correctly applying these drafts.<sup id="fnref:1:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/loom/scummvm-loom-fm-00004.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Each draft is a sequence of four notes within one octave. The player learns new drafts by exploring the environment and interacting with it through a simple point-and-click interface. Once a draft has been learned, it may be applied in a different situation in order to solve a problem. Drafts range from simple general actions (such as opening) to more specific and complex commands, e.g. turning straw into gold. Drafts can also be “reversed”, i.e. played backwards, in order to execute the opposite action (for example, closing something instead of opening). As the game progresses Bobbin learns to play higher notes on the distaff, allowing him to access more drafts.<sup id="fnref:1:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/loom/scummvm-loom-fm-00003.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game begins with an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcydSMadbcw">audio drama (YouTube)</a> that you originally would have listened to on casette tape (as your parents kids). This audio drama sets the stage for the game world and lays out the history of the world and how everyone is a member of one of four guilds. Bobbin is a member of the Guild of Weavers.</p>

<p>There is a whole lot of backstory presented in this audio drama, and I’ll be honest - I didn’t listen to all of it because it’s 30 minutes long and my attention span is … shorter than that. I did however read the synopsis on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loom_(video_game)#Prologue">Wikipedia</a> which answers a lot of questions, such as “whats with these swans?”.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/loom/scummvm-loom-fm-00008.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though Loom has three difficulty settings (I played on “Standard”), it’s an extremely simple game. Unlike most adventure games, there is no inventory management to worry about, no dialogue trees to navigate and very little backtracking. Your goals are pretty straightforward and can all be accomplished by doing essentially the same thing on every screen.</p>

<p>You click the mouse around the screen until the thing you click on is called out in the lower right of the screen. If this happens, you’ll either hear four notes on your distaff indicating there’s a new draft you can learn, or you’ll interact with whatever you just clicked on.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/loom/scummvm-loom-fm-00005.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Basically every draft you learn can be played either forwards or backwards. For example, once you learn the “Straw to Gold” draft, if you happen to select a pile of gold and play the draft backwards, it’ll now turn “Gold to Straw”. This mechanic is used throughout the game and in most cases presents a pretty obvious solution to a given puzzle.</p>

<p>It is important to write down the drafts you learn though, as the game doesn’t record them for you (unless you’re in “Tutorial” mode). If you play on the hardest difficulty you’ll need to listen to the drafts and try to remember the notes as there is no visual indicator as to what was just played on the distaff.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/loom/scummvm-loom-fm-00016.png" alt="" />
<em>Remember to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code> at everything by double-clicking before you select and cast a draft!</em></p>

<p>Being a LucasArts adventure there’s <em>supposed to be</em> no way to die or wind up in an unwinnable situation. I did find myself getting stuck at one point because I was following a walkthrough and I apparently jumped ahead a little too quickly. At one point you need to examine a pool to learn the “Reflect” draft, but before doing this I only single-clicked and inspected the pool - then cast a draft that drained the pool.</p>

<p>As a result, I never learned the necessary draft and found myself stuck once I reached the area where I needed to steal the young boy’s identity so I could sneak into the guild of blacksmith’s.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/loom/scummvm-loom-fm-00019.png" alt="" />
<em>You’re responsible for that boy’s brutal murder. Actions have consequences Bobbin!</em></p>

<p>Though this is a LucasArts adventure game, the themes it deals with are actually pretty dark. Once you reflect your image onto the young boy so you can sneak into the guild of blacksmith’s, the dragon you escaped from finds the boy napping and mistaking him for you, kills him out of revenge. The ghost of that child is then used to solve a puzzle a little later in the game.</p>

<p>You do “heal” the boy to bring him back to life, but this was gorier than I anticipated.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/loom/scummvm-loom-fm-00022.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The story advances through character closeups and general on-screen exposition dumps. Unlike other adventure games of this era, none of these interactions are … interactive. You aren’t actually conversing with a character, they’re just delivering one chunk of dialogue and letting you move on.</p>

<p>Since the story progresses in an extremely linear fashion it makes sense that these interactions would as well, but it does make this game feel a little like it’s on rails.</p>

<p>The world you’re exploring is interesting and there is a lot of lore here, but you miss a good chunk of it if you don’t invest the time to listen to that audio drama.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/loom/scummvm-loom-fm-00025.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you reach the endgame things actually get extremely easy. The fabric of the world is torn open and you need to go around casting (“drafting”?) <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HEAL</code> on all the tears after healing whoever is dead/dying on the other side of the tear. You’ll then end up by the loom and Chaos will start drafting songs you need to play in reverse.</p>

<p>Finally you cast the song that turns you into a swan and that’s the end of the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/loom/scummvm-loom-fm-00030.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Loom is a very interesting game with a unique game mechanic at the time. The music is all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a> compositions, the visuals are all excellent and the story is compelling. You really do have to invest the time to dig into all the material that comes with the game before you play it in order to truly appreciate Bobbin Threadbare’s world, but if you don’t bother then this is just a relatively simple point-and-click adventure.</p>

<p>There aren’t that many areas in this game to explore, and each area <em>maybe</em> has 2-3 action areas that you could potentially interact with. The draft you need to use on each action area is generally intuitive, so if you remembered to write them down (and wrote them down properly), it’s not hard to burn through this game.</p>

<p>I would definitely rank this title pretty low on my list of favourites when it comes to LucasArts’ catalogue, but as an entry level adventure game it’s not that bad.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/t/mongoserverselectionerror-c83200000a000152-ssl-routinesunsafe-legacy-renegotiation-disabled/262568">this community forum post</a> there was a report of the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/">MongoDB Node.js driver</a> failing to connect with the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MongoServerSelectionError: C8320000:error:0A000152:SSL routines:final_renegotiate:unsafe legacy renegotiation disabled:c:\ws\deps\openssl\openssl\ssl\statem\extensions.c:922</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This error doesn’t smell like a MongoDB-specific error, so digging into <em>“<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">final_renegotiate:unsafe legacy renegotiation disabled</code>“</em> specifically lead to <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/21296">this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openssl</code> issue</a> that looks to elaborate on the meaning of the error message:</p>

<blockquote class="prompt-info">
  <p>TLSv1.2 (and earlier) support the concept of renegotiation. In 2009 (i.e. after the TLSv1.2 RFC was published), a flaw was discovered with how renegotiation works that could lead to an attack. After the attack was discovered a fix was deployed to all TLS libraries. In order for the fixed version of renegotiation to work both the client and the server need to support it.</p>

  <p>The original (unfixed) version of renegotiation is known as “unsafe legacy renegotiation” in OpenSSL. The fixed version is known as “secure renegotiation”. So either a peer does not have the fix, in which case it will be using <em>“unsafe legacy renegotiation”</em>, or it does have the fix in which case it will be using <em>“secure renegotiation”</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it seems that the error originated from OpenSSL, and “that flaw” they’re alluding to was likely <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2009-3555">CVE-2009-3555</a>. What was particularly interesting about this issue is that it <em>only</em> occurred when the application was run using Node.js 20, while Node.js 16 didn’t exhibit any issues - so what’s different between those two versions? One notable change is that <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/openssl-november-2022">Node.js 17+ use OpenSSL 3.0 by default</a> - and starting with 3.0 <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/15127">secure negotiation support is required by default</a>.</p>

<p>For more information on secure server-side renegotiation I’d highly recommend <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/discussions/21747">this discussion</a>.</p>

<h2 id="configuring-openssl-via-the-nodejs-driver">Configuring OpenSSL via the Node.js Driver</h2>

<p>A similar issue was reported on Stack Overflow for the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">axios</code> library</a>, and the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/74600467/195509">solution</a> there was to pass <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">secureOptions: crypto.constants.SSL_OP_LEGACY_SERVER_CONNECT</code> during request creation. As <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">secureOptions</code> is an option passed to Node’s <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tlscreatesecurecontextoptions"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tls.createSecureContext</code></a> API (which MongoDB <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/fundamentals/connection/tls/#securecontext-example">documents an example of using</a>) it should be possible to do something similar with the Node.js driver.</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

<span class="p">});</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>SUCCESS! The above example allows a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SecureContext</code> object to be created with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">secureOptions</code> selected from the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#openssl-options">enumerated OpenSSL options Node.js has defined</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="prompt-tip">
  <p>Though the Node.js driver allows direct configuration of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SecureContext</code> object, as other <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/">MongoDB drivers</a> <em>may not</em>, <a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DRIVERS-2823">DRIVERS-2823</a> is being considered to ensure this type of configuration is available.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="alternative-configuration">Alternative Configuration</h2>

<p>Configuring the MongoDB Node.js driver’s OpenSSL options directly is likely the preferred approach, but the Node runtime can also be configured (via <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--openssl-configfile"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--openssl-config=file</code></a>). In this, when the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">node</code> process is executed the path to a custom OpenSSL configuration file could be provided as follows:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openssl.conf</code> is setup similar to the example below:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innocent_Until_Caught">Innocent Until Caught</a> is a graphic adventure game with an icon-based point-and-click interface.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iuc/innocent_004.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Jack T. Ladd is a thief, his hunting-ground is the whole galaxy, and at the moment, he’s in big trouble. He’s got 28 days to pay his taxes - or else the interstellar tax agency will hunt him down. Termination is a viable punishment for tax offenders in these days, you know. Stranded blank on the barren, run-down planet Tayte, Jack decides that he has to make some cash. Quick.</p>

<p>Innocent Until Caught is pretty standard in terms of design but introduces some innovations when it comes to the interface. It features a mini-window at the bottom left of the screen which is alternately a mini-map of the area (showing all exits) and a looking glass for detecting small items. The inventory is a box-window in which objects can be placed wherever player wants (even on top of others). Also, the plot is illustrated by a few rendered sequences, some of the first used in adventure games.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iuc/innocent_002.png" alt="" />
<em>Not too shabby looking for a cutscene from 1993</em></p>

<p>From the minute I started playing this game I got <a href="/blog/2023/02/10/beneath-a-steel-sky/">Beneath a Steel Sky</a> vibes. I didn’t realize that game came out a year later, so maybe I should be saying the reverse, but regardless of semantics Innocent Until Caught struck a tone with me. I am a huge sucker for games that seem to take place in either a post-apocalyptic future, a dystopian future or a cyberpunk setting.</p>

<p>This game is set in a dystopian future, but right away you’re treated to the comedic undertones that highlight the entire plot. It doesn’t take much of a stretch to envision this game having been written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Lowe">Al Lowe</a> as the backdrop for a slightly darker Leisure Suit Larry adventure.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iuc/innocent_021.png" alt="" />
<em>You know you wanna know what happens next …</em></p>

<p>Innocent Until Caught offers a pretty straightforward interface, though it overloads each interface area to perform double-duty. The bottom left area is a mini-map, however when you’re <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code>ing at something it will tell you what you’re hovering over. The mini-map also shows all exits to the current screen you can follow, which can be clicked on if you have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WALK</code> selected.</p>

<p>The middle area is your action/verb bar as well as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">STATUS</code> button. The status area gives you details about your progress and is where you can find save/load and configuration options.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iuc/innocent_033.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Your status screen also shows a profile of Jack T. Ladd which serves absolutely no purpose until the very end of the game, at which point you can use this to change your clothes to impersonate a guard.</p>

<p>Inventory management and item combinations are a massive part of this game. The third status area of the user interface which takes up about 2/3 of the screen is the inventory. There are just so many items you can pick up throughout this game - and I’m pretty sure ALL of them are required to progress.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iuc/innocent_016.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If there’s one thing I have to gripe about when it comes to this game it’s the <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=moon%20logic">moon logic</a> you need to apply to certain puzzles and item combinations. If you thought <a href="https://musingsofanitpickinggirl.wordpress.com/2018/10/15/can-we-talk-about-the-monkey-wrench-puzzle/">Monkey Island’s “Monkey Wrench”</a> puzzle was obtuse, wait until you get a load of this game.</p>

<p>Need to break into a bank? Get the plans for it from the bank first, then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">USE</code> those plans in the sewer to find your way to an alcove that shows where the wall is the weakest. To get through that wall you’ll need to blow a hole in it. Put a mushroom in front of the alcove, then release a fly that will fly into the mushroom causing it to explode. How do you catch that fly? First find a jar and a lid (make sure to combine them when you find them). How do you get the fly in the jar? Fill it with mayonnaise of course!</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iuc/innocent_018.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Fly flies into the mushroom and BOOM goes the wall. Well that was easy … right?</p>

<p>I’m assuming there must have been some conversational hint or observation when you <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INSPECT</code> something somewhere because I read through the <a href="http://www.replacementdocs.com/download.php?view.6546">manual</a> and didn’t find any mention of the fly … or a mushroom. The manual does give you a couple clues to some of these puzzles though like <em>“Try to find an alternative way to enter the zoo. When you do, how you smell might mean the difference between life and death.”</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iuc/innocent_001.raw1.png" alt="" />
<em>Yet another feat of mental gymnastics will be required to get past this monster</em></p>

<p>Though the puzzles can be ridiculously difficult to solve, the game as a whole is pretty forgiving. I didn’t die once - not did I find myself in an unwinnable situation. I don’t actually know if it’s possible to do either of these as I’m assuming the game just doesn’t let you advance until you have all the necessary items to progress past the area you’re trying to get to.</p>

<p>I leaned on the walkthrough pretty heavily during this playthrough so I’m not 100% sure if this is the case, but whenever I tried to put Jack in danger the game just sort of told me “you can’t do that”.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iuc/innocent_017.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When you’re not scanning every inch of every screen to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SEE</code> if there’s an item to pick up, you can progress the plot by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TALK</code>ing to most characters. These interactions take place in a conversation view where you typically have 3 options you can choose from in any situation. You can also inspect what you’re being told to pull out keywords from a conversation to ask more about this (the cursor will turn to a question mark when you find a keyword in a response).</p>

<p>I only used this once or twice during the game so it’s not a major mechanic, but it does add some variety to these interactions.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iuc/innocent_023.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The writing in this game is excellent, and it’s worth noting that the themes and dialogue of Innocent Until Caught are not for kids. I think this actually drew me in more as it felt like a more mature game and it gave the writers more leeway to inject adult humour and themes throughout.</p>

<p>I was very much sucked into this game world and enjoyed <em>most</em> of the experience … but then you try to break out of jail.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iuc/innocent_024.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The jailbreak sequence involves navigating a maze. I HATE MAZES. This was just unnecessarily drawn out because there’s nothing to do but grind your way through using trial and error until you muddle your way to the end. I’m sure there are people that genuinely enjoy mazes, but I’m not one of those people so I call them out whenever I encounter them (as I did with <a href="/blog/2023/09/06/manhunter-san-francisco/">Manhunter 2: San Francisco</a>, <a href="/blog/2023/05/31/return-to-ringworld/">Return to Ringworld</a> and <a href="/blog/2023/11/24/the-legend-of-kyrandia/">The Legend of Kyrandia: Fables and Fiends</a>).</p>

<p>Thankfully this is only one sequence and you can burn through it in about 20-30 minutes (depending on how much backtracking you have to do).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iuc/innocent_013.png" alt="" />
<em>If you’re unable to board the train, you’re using DOSBox and your CPU cycles are below 6000</em></p>

<p>The majority of the initial act of the game takes place in 5 different areas which are accessible by subway. Once you visit each area (by waiting for the subway to get there) you’ll be able to “fast travel” by getting on the subway at any stop, looking at the subway map and just clicking the stop you want to go to. This is EXTREMELY convenient as it allows you to bypass the drawn out subway ride between stops.</p>

<p>One issue I had with the subway was that I found myself unable to progress the first time I played this game. Every time the subway car would stop and open the doors I clicked like a maniac to get Jack to board the train cycling through every verb/action available … but nothing worked. It turns out that this is a known (but poorly documented) issue you’ll run into if playing the game via DOSBox.</p>

<p>If you want to avoid the frustration, start the game as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Launch DOSBox</li>
  <li>Increase the <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/wiki/Performance#CPU_Cycles_.28speed_up.2Fslow_down.29">CPU cycles</a> beyond 6000 (default is 3000)</li>
  <li>Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INNOCENT.EXE</code> to start the game</li>
</ol>

<p>You can now board the train successfully. You have to follow this sequence as increasing the cycles once the game is already running doesn’t seem to work. Once you’ve done the above you can restore a game right before you board the train and you should board successfully.</p>

<p>Note that you <em>can’t</em> change your audio configuration and then load a save state. If you do so the audio just won’t work and you’ll have to play the rest of the game in silence. This was a bit frustrating as I wanted to play through using either the Soundblaster or Roland configuration … but I started with Adlib so that’s what I rolled with.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iuc/innocent_020.png" alt="" />
<em>The game does give you A LOT of clues as to what you may need to do next</em></p>

<p>The music is atmospheric and appropriate - though limited. There are a handful of background songs that the game will cycle through based on the screen you’re on, and the samples are pretty short so you’ll notice the looping. This is a pretty minor complaint though as the songs are pretty good.</p>

<p>Aside from some technical challenges and a maze that I could have done without, this game came as a pleasant surprise. I’ve heard of it numerous times over the years but never took the time to try it out myself - but I’m really glad I did.</p>

<p>Since there’s a sequel (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilty_(video_game)">Guilty</a>) that came out a couple years later I’m now looking forward to when I get to tackle that title as well.</p>

<p>I’d recommend this game, though you’ll likely need a walkthrough to solve some of the puzzles. Do yourself a favour though and setup your preferred audio device before you start the game ;)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniac_Mansion:_Day_of_the_Tentacle">Day of the Tentacle</a> is a 1993 graphic adventure game developed and published by LucasArts and is the sequel to the 1987 game Maniac Mansion. The plot follows Bernard Bernoulli and his friends Hoagie and Laverne as they attempt to stop the evil Purple Tentacle - a sentient, disembodied tentacle - from taking over the world.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dott/scummvm-tentacle-00000.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Day of the Tentacle is a point-and-click adventure game and a sequel to Maniac Mansion. The player controls Bernard, and later also Hoagie and Laverne, being able to switch between them at any time. By using the commands at the bottom of the screen, the character can pick up items, use them on other things, talk to people, and more. Any of the three friends can also send his items across time to another friend.</p>

<p>The game takes place in the same area, but in three different eras, and thus affecting history takes a vital part in some puzzles. For instance, Hoagie can hide an item in the 18th century, and Laverne discovers it in the 23rd century - but by then, the item may have been affected by time and changed its properties.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dott/scummvm-tentacle-00005.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I’m not going to try to hide it - Day of the Tentacle is probably one of my favourite adventure games of all time. Though it can take 6-8 hours to finish without a walkthrough, I’ve played through it enough times that I was able to burn through it in about 45-50 minutes for this article.</p>

<p>Though I’ve played it countless times, from the moment you boot it up and the title sequence starts your attention is immediately grabbed and you are sucked into this weird world where tentacles can move around and talk. If you haven’t played Maniac Mansion the existence of the tentacles won’t really make any sense (I think it’s elaborated on there), but it’s not really all that important to the advancement of the plot.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dott/scummvm-tentacle-00008.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you gain control of Bernard you’ll have a short sequence that encourages you to explore a single room until you realize you can open the clock to find Dr. Fred’s secret lab in the basement. I think this is meant to be a sort of tutorial sequence to get players used to the verbs available (bottom left) and the inventory system (bottom right).</p>

<p>Since this is a game from 1993 the interface and layout was pretty intuitive, so I appreciate that you could quickly progress beyond the scripted sequence, meet the other two characters you’d eventually be able to control and advance the plot to the time travel subplot.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dott/scummvm-tentacle-00019.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The two characters that accompany Bernard on this adventure weren’t present in Maniac Mansion - though Hoagie seems to be a cross between <a href="http://www.maniacmansionfan.50webs.com/characters.html">Jeff and Razor</a>. Hoagie finds himself sent back in time where he gets to meet the founding fathers, and Laverne is shot into the future.</p>

<p>A large part of the games mechanics is to make changes in the past to create changes in the future. For example, as soon as the Cron-O-John sends everyone their separate ways Laverne lands in a tree and gets stuck. You only get access to Hoagie and Bernard as a result as you can’t actually use Laverne until she’s free.</p>

<p>To solve this puzzle you need to get rid of that tree - but this needs to be done in the past.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dott/scummvm-tentacle-00015.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Hoagie strikes up a conversation with George Washington and challenges him to see if he’s “still got it” when it comes to chopping down cherry trees. If you’re not an American (I’m not) knowing this is the solution to a puzzle might be a bit confusing, but the game only gives you so many dialogue options so it’s not that hard to figure out (also, apparently <a href="https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/cherry-tree-myth/">this was a myth</a>).</p>

<p>You paint the fruit on the tree red, talk to Washington, he chops the tree down and Laverne is free!</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dott/scummvm-tentacle-00026.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Dr. Fred’s relatives can be found throughout the time periods and they’ll help advance the story. Your goal is to recharge the Cron-O-John in each time period and get back to the present to stop the Purple Tentacle. You’ll do this though myriad fetch quests and item puzzles.</p>

<p>Need a vacuum in the future - put a flyer in the suggestion box in the past that says all basements must have vacuums. Need a hamster in the future - put one in the ice box in the present and then thaw him out in the future and give him a sweater to warm him up.</p>

<p>Though a little contrived, these puzzles are typically pretty straightforward and the game gives you plenty of clues as to how they need to be solved.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dott/scummvm-tentacle-00022.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though I love this game it’s important to note it’s not perfect. The voice acting can be rough to listen to at times, but the writing is so good you’ll likely let this one slide. There are a handful of characters you can interact with, but most of them offer extremely limited conversation trees and typically exist as a barrier between you and some item you need for some puzzle.</p>

<p>The solution to certain puzzles requires you to be aware of certain concepts that a child likely wouldn’t understand. The notion that <em>“it always rains right after I was my car”</em> is needed to solve a puzzle in the past, but this is not something a child would be aware of and would result in the puzzle being unnecessarily complex. I played this game for the first time when I was 14 and I seem to remember getting past this just based on in-game clues, but the cause and effect of washing the carriage resulting in rain made zero sense to me then.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dott/scummvm-tentacle-00031.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Day of the Tentacle is an extremely approachable adventure game for new players to the genre. It has the right mix of humor to keep the plot progression enjoyable, is well structured and balanced and doesn’t contain dead ends or unwinnable scenarios.</p>

<p>A really cool easter egg you can find is that the original Maniac Mansion game is hidden on the computer in Ed’s room. Just clicking <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code> on the computer will allow you to play though the entire game if you want - though this didn’t work for me during this playthough. When I tried to play the embedded Maniac Mansion my instance of ScummVM crashed:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>Assertion failed: (endP &gt;= beginP), function BaseString, file str-base.cpp, line 118.
[1]    22698 abort      scummvm
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I ended up have to restart from the beginning because I didn’t save my game once … oops. I also filed this with the ScummVM team as <a href="https://bugs.scummvm.org/ticket/14892"><em>#14892 - DOTT: Crash when trying to play MM on Ed’s computer</em></a>.</p>

<p>If it were possible to play more games in this series or in this universe I’d be all in, but unfortunately it doesn’t look like this will be the case anytime soon. As a result, if you haven’t played Day of the Tentacle I’d highly recommend either the original version or picking up the <a href="https://www.gog.com/index.php/en/game/day_of_the_tentacle_remastered">remastered version on GOG</a></p>
