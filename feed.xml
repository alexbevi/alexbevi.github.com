<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Knight:_Sins_of_the_Fathers">Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers</a> is a 1993 point-and-click adventure game, developed and published by Sierra On-Line for MS-DOS, Macintosh, and Windows, and released on December 17, 1993. The CD-ROM version features the voice talents of Tim Curry, Mark Hamill, Michael Dorn, Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., and Leah Remini. The game’s story focuses on Gabriel Knight, a struggling novelist and owner of a rare book store in New Orleans, who opts to research a recent spate of murders around the city that have a connection to voodoo. In the process, he is slowly revealed to be a descendant of a German family who are involved in combatting people who use supernatural forces, and discovers a link between the killings and his family’s past.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gk1/scummvm-gk1-cd-win-00048.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>First off, I love the darker and more mature theme of this game. While investigating the murder (“for his book”), Gabriel has access to crime scenes and evidence as his friend Detective Mosley believes it’s just research. Mosley thinks Gabriel is going to include him as a character, so he gives him a lot more access than he likely should have.</p>

<p>Several key story points trigger cut scenes that are presented as multi-panel art boxes. As this gives the game a Graphic Novel feel I actually like it a lot more than if they resorted to FMVs or scripted events.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gk1/scummvm-gk1-cd-win-00011.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You move around the French Quarter of New Orleans via a quick travel map, with additional locations being added as you advance the story. There really aren’t too many locations in this game, with several only being visited once. When you move to the greater New Orleans map, there are a couple more locations you have access to, but overall the game keeps you focused on a dozen or less areas you need to return to.</p>

<p>This makes the game feel a lot bigger than it actually is, but not overwhelming as you will need to backtrack to a number of these key locations as you uncover new dialogue options that you’ll then need to try out on every character you’ve spoken to already.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gk1/scummvm-gk1-cd-win-00003.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Character interactions are all presented on a static screen with various topics you can ask. Every character gets the the same key topics, with some character-specific topics also presented to help flesh out their backgrounds and motivations. These are actually colour-coded which is a nice quality of life feature to help you identify when you’ve surfaced a keyword you should likely go ask others about.</p>

<p>If you’re playing the CD version of the game, all interactions are voiced by professional actors and it really shows in the quality of the delivery. Tim Curry’s performance as Gabriel Knight really draws you into the story. Though this game was remade for the <a href="https://www.postudios.com/company/games/gabrielknight20th/">20th Anniversary by Phoenix Online Studios</a> I don’t know that I’d have enjoyed it nearly as much with a different cast.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gk1/scummvm-gk1-cd-win-00034.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The theme of underground cartels, secret organizations and voodoo is ever present throughout this game and most game scenes represent this extremely well. Though this is still an SCI game using pixel art, it is very expressive and stays true to the darker content and themes of the game.</p>

<p>To really draw you in the soundtrack also fits perfectly and further draws you into the overall experience. Sierra Music Central has the <a href="http://www.sierramusiccentral.com/gk1cd.html">full soundtrack</a> available for free if you want to check out any tracks. My personal favourite would be the <a href="http://www.sierramusiccentral.com/musics/gk1cd/GK1Track05.mp3">theme to St. George’s Bookshop</a> - go ahead, give it a listen.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gk1/scummvm-gk1-cd-win-00001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game takes place over the course of 10 days, with the story progressing in a linear fashion. Each day you have a certain number of key events you need to complete in order to progress, and you’ll know you’ve finished these because Gabriel will indicate it’s getting late and time to head home. Though the game is very well structured and if you exhaust all the dialogue options available with each character each day you shouldn’t get stuck, I found myself unable to progress past day 4 for longer than I care to admit.</p>

<p>After doing a bit of hunting around online for the solution, apparently <a href="https://www.neoseeker.com/forums/1378/t225489-day-4-won-end/">others have hit the same roadblock</a> so I felt a little less stupid needing to look for help. Turns out I needed to go to Moonbeam and show her the markings from the tomb you copied earlier using the sketchbook (which teaches you about the Rada drums I believe).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gk1/scummvm-gk1-cd-win-00031.png" alt="" />
<em>It takes a bit of patience, but the pattern matching puzzles aren’t too difficult</em></p>

<p>There are a few instances in this game where you’ll need to work with the Rada drums in order to either decode or send message. Initially I thought this was going to be tedious, but it was relatively well done and you weren’t presented with a ridiculous number of useless options you’d need to wade through in order to match the right patterns.</p>

<p>As long as you’re paying attention to the clues the game is giving you it’s not too difficult to figure out what the message is you’re supposed to write on the tomb with the brick either. Thankfully the game will tell you right away if it’s the wrong message when you exit the screen so you’re not just blindly waiting for some scripted event to occur that’s never going to happen.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gk1/scummvm-gk1-cd-win-00006.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Since this is a Sierra SCI game the top of the screen hides the menu bar, which is a bit more involved than most of the Quest series. The typical action icons exist (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TALK</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WALK</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TAKE</code>, etc) and you can access your inventory, but there’s also an option for the tape recorder. Since Gabriel is an author and is interviewing people for his book, he’s recording all conversations for future reference.</p>

<p>This is extremely useful as you can revisit every conversation you’ve had and review what topics were discussed and what the answers were. For those of us that don’t write everything down but wonder on occasion “what did XXX say about YYY?”, this is an invaluable tool.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gk1/scummvm-gk1-cd-win-00046.png" alt="" />
<em>These zombies will fuck you up</em></p>

<p>Certain situations Gabriel finds himself in can lead to death and a game over. This is not unexpected in a Sierra Online game, but it was refreshing to find that these were rare occurrences, and were somewhat expected. I’m not sure if there are any game-ending deaths earlier in the game, but later when you’re trying to get out of Snake Mound and you wake the zombies, if one of them catches you they’ll make quick work of you.</p>

<p>When you finally find the voodoo honfour, if you summon Brother Eagle but don’t get out of the hallway in time, he’ll catch and kill you.</p>

<p>Like most Sierra Online games, this game has a speed toggle in the settings - which you’ll likely want to increase as Gabriel walks pretty slowly. I’m guessing speeding up the game likely wouldn’t only affect his walk speed though so it probably wouldn’t help you in these situations.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gk1/scummvm-gk1-cd-win-00051.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Sins of the Fathers is one of my all time favourite adventure games. The story is just fantastic and keeps you drawn in until the very end. The pacing is spot on and though some of the puzzles can be a bit difficult, nothing you do feels like busy work to pad out the game.</p>

<p>There really aren’t a lot of locations you need to visit, so backtracking is less of a chore, and if you missed something or forgot to ask someone something it doesn’t take long to fill that gap to advance the plot. I also didn’t find there were any unwinnable situations as I don’t believe a given day will end unless you’ve done everything and picked up everything that’s required.</p>

<p>This is a title I would highly recommend to anyone interested in adventure gaming. Do yourself a favour though and play this game on ScummVM with <a href="https://docs.scummvm.org/en/v2.6.1/advanced_topics/understand_audio.html#what-is-mt-32">MT-32 device emulation</a>. It makes an already awesome soundtrack all that much more awesome!</p>

<p>I never finished either of the sequels, though I did try them and was disappointed so not looking forward to having to slog through those when the time comes. For now though I’m still basking in a great gaming experience.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torin%27s_Passage">Torin’s Passage</a> is a point-and-click adventure game developed and published by Sierra On-Line in 1995. The game was designed by Al Lowe, author of the Leisure Suit Larry series.</p>

<p>The game starts off with some royalty being killed by a wizard and what you assume is the royal baby being saved by a maid or something. She saves Torin, but is punished for this good deed by being shackled with a collar that keeps slowly tightening until it will eventually kill her. I think she then becomes evil or something and teams up with the wizard that killed the royal family, but honestly I sort of spaced out pretty quickly.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/torin/scummvm-torin-00001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>My main issue with this game was the story comes off as a generic fantasy crammed full of tropes but laid out in what feels like the laziest way possible. Torin grows up with farmers as his adopted parents, something happens, an evil sorceress captures your adopted family and you then need to go save them. This is done by traveling to the “lands below” by throwing magic powder at crystals that send you deeper and deeper into the earth.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/torin/scummvm-torin-00019.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Each chapter of the game represents your descent through the layers of the world as you slowly work your way to the core where your parents may be. This is done by completing fetch quest after fetch quest, solving a handful of puzzles and constantly backtracking.</p>

<p>This is pretty standard fare for a lot of adventure games, but everything in this game just sort of feels forced and a bit sloppy. I get that Al Lowe wanted to write a game that he could play with his young daughter, but the game he wrote seemed to just be a rip off of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Framed_Roger_Rabbit">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a> and King’s Quest VII.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/torin/scummvm-torin-00016.png" alt="" />
<em>Maybe I’m being too critical, but the game just looks like shit</em></p>

<p>Adding insult to injury, the game just doesn’t look that good. For a game that came out in late 1995 I really expected a lot more. The UI is bland and takes up the lower third of the screen. Your inventory is always visible, and you can take any item in your inventory and put it on the center pedestal to “zoom in” and examine the items. Very few items are worth doing this with, and when you do the “lasers” (green circle things) on each side of the inventory shoot it for some reason.</p>

<p>Just look at it. If this were a game from the mid 80’s I’d be a lot more forgiving, but again … this is 1995 and Sierra has made a LOT of much MUCH better games. Weirdly enough the visual style of this game reminded more of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link:_The_Faces_of_Evil_and_Zelda:_The_Wand_of_Gamelon">CD-i Zelda games</a> more than anything else. Google some pictures from those games and tell me you don’t see it ;)</p>

<p>I mentioned this game reminded me of Roger Rabbit because you’ve got a sidekick throughout named Boogle that seems to provide the exact same style of comic relief. Sometimes it’s even identical (they lifted some lines and scenarios directly from the movie).</p>

<p>The Boogle character at least adds a bit of variety to the game as he can transform into things you can use to solve certain puzzles. Typically you’ll use each Boogle form exactly once though, so the amount of variety it adds is limited.</p>

<em>Oh god … puns … so many puns</em></p>

<p>Unlike the Leisure Suit Larry games though, Torin’s Passage isn’t very funny - or for that matter, fun. From the time you start playing until the time you finally decide you’ve had enough and are ready to move on to a better game you’ll just feel like you’re going through the motions of playing a game.</p>

<p>I just didn’t find the writing to be all that compelling - and I am a fan of Al Lowe (including following him on <a href="https://twitter.com/allowe">Twitter</a>). I’m not sure how actively involved he was in the actual content generation (since he was the director), but the game just felt derivative and slapped together.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/torin/scummvm-torin-00027.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>What I did find a bit innovative was the built in hint system. You have a hint timer that you can configure, which after elapsing allows you to get a hint on how to proceed. If you’re newer to the genre this might come in handy as some of the puzzles are a bit obtuse and overly complex.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/torin/scummvm-torin-00021.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are a couple puzzles at the end of Chapter 4 (I think that’s the right chapter) where you need to move these miniature dudes around in order to unlock (something). The whole “harmony” concept means you need to shuffle them around until you align them by colour, but which colours go where is not immediately obvious.</p>

<p>Once you finally solve this (likely with a walkthrough), you’ll then have to do basically the same fucking puzzle but instead by rotating 2 characters at a time to get them in descending orders. This took FOREVER, and was NOT FUN. I really, REALLY hate arbitrary puzzles that feel like padding. I don’t have a problem with challenging puzzles, especially if it feels like you’ve gained the tools to solve the puzzle by naturally playing the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/torin/scummvm-torin-00039.png" alt="" />
<em>No ending - just credits</em></p>

<p>When you finally muddle your way to the finale, the game just sort of ends (cuts to credits). Apparently this is because Al Lowe planned for Torin’s Passage to be the first of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010128170800/http://larry.adventuregamer.com/allinterview.html">5 games in a series</a>. Obviously this never came to pass, and it’s likely because this game just wasn’t all that good.</p>

<p>Sierra Online made so many better games before this title came out, so it’s extremely disappointing to have to trudge through this turd. Boogle could have been a game changer if they’d incorporated him more deeply into the plot (or bothered to introduce him at all). The mechanic of having horizontal and vertical sliders so you can pan around a larger scene without having to walk around was interesting, but again, this wasn’t introduced. When you needed to actually use this panning mechanic to solve a puzzle it wasn’t obvious that this was how you approach the solution.</p>

<p>I would not recommend this title to anyone. It’s just not fun, or interesting, or innovative in any way. Some component pieces had promise and might have (or possible DID) work better in other games, but Torin’s Passage isn’t worth anyone’s time today.</p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Return_to_Ringworld">Return to Ringworld</a> is the sequel to the previous game based on Larry Niven’s “Known Space” series of novels (Ringworld). Once again this game is a point and click adventure/puzzle solving game.</p>

<p>After saving the puppeteer race from extermination and uncovering some powerful ancient technology on the first game, Quinn, Seeker of Vengeance and Miranda Rees find themselves searched as fugitives by all three major species, so they go to Ringworld to hide. Once in Ringworld they’ll try to uncover some evidence to clear their names, but they stumble across another universe-threatening plot. This time U.N. general Carson Teal is out to rule the universe by uncovering Ringworld’s secrets, and you must stop him.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/r2rw/r2rw_017.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This game is way, WAY bigger than it’s predecessor, with hundreds of screens, mazes, etc. Plus you get to play as all three characters throughout the game, a la Day of the Tentacle. This is actually a big part of the game this time around once you get going as the story progresses from the vantage point of each character. Miranda is on the ship for most of the game, but Quinn and Seeker head out together to explore the Ringworld - typically to navigate their way through some form of maze …</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/r2rw/r2rw_013.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Return to Ringworld is basically just a series of mazes … and I fucking hate mazes in adventure games. They needlessly delay story progression and feel bolted on to artificially inflate the time it takes to finish the game. Don’t get me wrong, if I’m playing an RPG I <em>expect</em> there to be dungeons (mazes) I need to map in order to progress, find items, fight monsters, gain experience and so on … but I find it frustrating in adventure games.</p>

<p>You have a comm unit that acts as a navigation tool for some of these mazes, but for others you need to draw maps to keep track of where you’ve been, where you’re going and where key items are located. Again, if this were an RPG … cool … but I know it’s just bloating a fetch quest.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/r2rw/r2rw_021.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>One task Seeker needs to complete in order to get a balloon to escape the spill mountains (I think it was here) is to rid them of a vampire problem by first completing a series of fetch quests to build a breathing mask to prevent the vampire pheromones from driving Seeker mad, then navigating a giant maze to hunt down all vampires and exterminate them. This section of the game honestly felt like it took the majority of my play time as it involved endless backtracking to hunt down these vampires and kill them. You have no indication as to how many you need to kill other than a message that gets displayed when you finally kill them all.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/r2rw/r2rw_022.png" alt="" />
<em>I guess I got them all. FINALLY!</em></p>

<p>Though the game is much bigger than its predecessor <a href="/blog/2022/12/19/ringworld/">Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch</a>, I found there were some serious detractors from the experience. First of all, the walk speeds are abysmally slow. I know I can play this game on ScummVM, but I chose to play on DOSBox-X instead because I could crank the CPU cycles to Turbo whenever navigating one of the many, many mazes.</p>

<p>Second, though they’re not badly done, there are far too many drawn out cut scenes.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/r2rw/r2rw_029.png" alt="" />
<em>Pretty, but how long do I have to sit here and watch this animation</em></p>

<p>I think the Tsunami artists focused a little too heavily on the filler and too little on the gameplay.</p>

<p>Since this is an adventure game, the story is central to the experience, and in this case it did not disappoint. The character interactions were interesting, the story progressed in a linear fashion and kept me engaged and I looked forward to seeing where it would take me next.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/r2rw/r2rw_011.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Character interactions will either follow the typical linear progression or offer you a dialogue tree you can follow. The conversations are well written and they do a good job of injecting a lot of elements from the books such as characters, locations, historic events, species and slang (TANJ!). Since I really enjoyed these books as a teenager the settings you were dropped into and the elements of the world you engaged with felt natural.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/r2rw/r2rw_009.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Background music and sound effects were limited, but present. The music in general mostly felt generic, but I appreciated that it was there as my characters waded through all the mazes (yes, here I go again with the mazes!). All character dialogue is voice acted, and honestly they did a pretty good job of it. I ended up disabling speech and going with just text as I could read faster than the actors could deliver the lines. This is one game that offered support for the Roland MT-32, so if playing in ScummVM or DOSBox you can emulate this interface for some better synthesized tunes (check out a sample <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rajzeyau-Lo">of the intro sequence</a>).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/r2rw/r2rw_031.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you make your way through the final maze and defeat Teal by letting a Ghoul get him, you escape to a location that appears to be off the Ringworld. Where did you end up? Maybe we’ll find out in a sequel? Turns out … no, because Tsunami only made these 2 titles. I really did enjoy the story, even if playing the game seemed to get in the way occasionally. If you, like me, made it this far and still hunger for more Ringworld lore, check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringworld_series">series of books</a>. I guarantee they’ll quench your thirst for Sci-Fi goodness!</p>

<p>As for this game, I’d recommend maybe passing it by. <a href="/blog/2022/12/19/ringworld/">Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch</a> felt like a tighter package and game play experience, which if you’re looking for a quick virtual romp through the Ringworld is likely the better choice.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companions_of_Xanth">Companions of Xanth</a> is based on Piers Anthony’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanth">Xanth novels</a> and loosely follows the plot of his 1993 novel <em>Demons Don’t Dream</em>, in which a young man uses a computer game to enter and explore the world of Xanth.</p>

<p>Typical of Piers Anthony’s novels, the game is filled with puns and visual gags, and some knowledge of the Xanth universe is helpful; for those players who haven’t read any of the Xanth novels, an in-game ‘Com-Pendium of Xanth’ is provided to the player for the majority of the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/xanth/xanth_001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The whole premise of this game is that you’ve been sucked into this fantasy world through your computer to act as an avatar for a force of good (or evil?) to undergo a quest to find some legendary artifact. Your opponent, who is the avatar for the other force of good (or evil?) is another person from Earth that has been recruited in the same fashion as you.</p>

<p>As you begin to explore the house on Earth where the game starts you’re presented with a pretty standard adventure game interface. The left hand side of the screen contains the fixed verb list, below that is navigation and options, to the right is your “party” view followed by descriptive text and your inventory.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/xanth/xanth_017.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After figuring out how to initially navigate, answering the phone, accepting the bet, getting the package and putting the disk in your computer you’ll be whisked off to the world of Xanth. This is a fantasy setting that apparently you (the player) don’t believe in. As a result you’re seen by the residents of the world as a floating computer screen.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/xanth/xanth_005.png" alt="" />
<em>The animation speeds are painfully slow during these sequences</em></p>

<p>Aside from the static view of the world you see most of the time, on occasion you’ll be greeted with a cut scene. This appears to be digitized photos animated at a rate of like 1 frame per minute, as the “action” during these exchanges just crawls. I tried cranking up the CPU cycles in DOSBox-X a few times to see if it helped, but it really wasn’t any better.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/xanth/xanth_006.png" alt="" />
<em>Nada the Naga Princess joins you on your quest to save Xanth</em></p>

<p>You’re not alone on this adventure, as you are joined by a companion from Xanth. I can’t remember if you could actually choose or if you were forced down a fixed selection path but I went with Nada Naga. Her icon will be present in the “party” view whenever she’s with you, and on every screen you can ask her questions, or ask for tips. She’s actually quite useful and helping to direct you to your next goal, and occasionally is a required piece of a multi-pronged puzzle you’ll have to solve.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/xanth/xanth_010.png" alt="" />
<em>The boat is a censor-ship … get it … GET IT??????</em></p>

<p>The puzzles is where this game kind of falls apart - especially if you’re not a native English speaker. EVERYTHING in this game is a pun, and on more than one occasion the solution requires you to not only know that it’s a pun, or double-entendre - but how to turn that phrase into meaning something literal.</p>

<p>I can’t imagine this was fun for kids playing in the early 90’s. I would have been 13 when this came out and the solutions to these puzzles would have just frustrated me to no end. Getting past the “Fireman and Hot Dog” for example requires you to ask Nada if she’s feeling hot, and when she says she is to ask her to put her hair in a bun. Then you take that bun, and put mustard on it. The fireman’s “hot dog” is afraid of the bun with mustard on it so he disappears.</p>

<p>To get the fireman to move along you need to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WAIT</code> for a minute, and he’ll give you fire water (because I guess he’s an alcoholic). Would a younger player know that this is alcohol - which then is needed in solving a fetch quest/item combo puzzle? Probably not …</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/xanth/xanth_022.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Waiting is also a recurring solution to puzzles. There is a dedicated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WAIT</code> command that will occasionally cause some condition on the current screen to change. Sometimes this is to get a different dialogue option, sometimes it’s to allow something to happen. For example the shimmering door in the desert will <em>eventually</em> appear if you alternate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WAIT</code>ing and asking Nada questions. I think she alludes to you having to be patient or something - I honestly don’t remember.</p>

<p>The main screen area can contain a larger text area when more information needs to be communicated, which is nicer than having to continually scroll the 2 lines the info bar typically presents you with.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/xanth/xanth_019.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are a dozen or so NPCs that you will interact with throughout the game, and this is done via a standard dialogue tree. These interactions do advance the plot, but typically not before setting up some random fetch quest that involves a tedious amount of backtracking.</p>

<p>Though most areas are pretty short, some areas like the Burrow are enormous and maze-like. Thankfully the game gives you a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MAP</code> view that makes navigating these sections of the game a lot easier as they contain landmarks on each tile to help you remember what was where.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/xanth/xanth_013.png" alt="" />
<em>You’ll be really happy there’s a map once you reach the Burrow</em></p>

<p>From a gameplay perspective there is some generic looping ambient music, but it just fades into the background along with any sound effects so playing this game on mute would not detract from the overall experience. The artwork is pretty good on the static screens, but the cut scenes are so janky that you might forget about the parts of the game you were just enjoying visually.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/xanth/xanth_026.png" alt="" />
<em>Oh right, you get points too</em></p>

<p>Companions of Xanth is not breaking any new ground in the adventure game genre. The writing is not particularly good, but this may just be the adaptation of Piers Anthony’s work focusing too heavily on the puns and wordplay and less on character development and world building. I did leave this experience wanting to know a bit more about the world of Xanth, but not the game world - the books. I have a feeling these worlds are better experienced in writing than in game form, but that’s just my 2 cents.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWeb">DreamWeb</a> is an MS-DOS and Amiga point-and-click cyberpunk top-down adventure game released in 1994, developed by Creative Reality and published by Empire Interactive Entertainment. The game features mature themes and a dark plot filled with violence and brief full frontal nudity; a rarity for games at the time.</p>

<p>You play as Ryan, a bartender in a futuristic city who’s been having weird dreams of an entity known as the Dreamweb. In the dream that opens the game, Ryan is asked by the master monk of the Keepers to be the deliverer and kill the seven evils, who are united to break the Dreamweb and send mankind spiraling into chaos.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dreamweb/scummvm-dreamweb-cd-00031.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>ScummVM announced support for DreamWeb in May of 2012, and though I tried it out at the time I honestly didn’t like the game. I’m pretty sure this was because I didn’t really do anything more than load it, try to move around, get thoroughly confused and quit. To appreciate this game you need to actually read the material that it’s distributed with (the <em>“Diary of a (Mad?) Man”</em> - which is available for free on the ScummVM site) as it helps setup the backstory.</p>

<p>The interface is also a very different as you only get about 33% of the screen dedicated to the game world. The rest is taken up by a top bar that gives you tools like save/load/inspect, and down the left hand side of the screen is a large view of Ryan. This actually acts as your inventory access as well as a zoom window so you can more closely inspect things on screen you may want to interact with.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dreamweb/scummvm-dreamweb-cd-00006.png" alt="" />
<em>Nothing like barging into the can to have a conversation while someone’s taking a shit</em></p>

<p>Each screen is static and doesn’t scroll, though as you move the mouse around you’ll find hotspots called out in the zoom window that you can interact with. If you can move in a certain direction this will be shown using arrows, and if there are characters on screen you can interact with, they’ll spill their line of dialogue along with a voice-acted version of the text.</p>

<p>There’s no branching dialogue trees in this game, which is kind of a nice change. Everyone has a fixed message they want to relay, and once they’ve done that you can either ask them to repeat it or move along.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dreamweb/scummvm-dreamweb-cd-00014.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can interact with almost every single element of the environment that has a label. When you do so, depending on what it is you’ve selected you may be presented with additional interaction options in the top right of the screen indicating actions you can take. This is sort of the verb menu you’d get in other adventure games, though I have to admit I found this more contextual approach a lot more intuitive.</p>

<p>This is how you can pick up items, combine items and talk to people.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dreamweb/scummvm-dreamweb-cd-00018.png" alt="" />
<em>I guess if you gotta go, go out with a “bang” …</em></p>

<p>As the monks have selected you to terminate the 7 evils, ultimately your goal is to hunt down these individuals and murder them. Killing the first target is sort of the hardest as it’s sort of like the “training mission” to get you acclimated to the game, controls, world and story. Figuring out how to get a gun is a bit challenging, and figuring out where the first target (David Crane) is takes some trial and error.</p>

<p>You basically just need to click on everything, inspect everything, talk to everyone and try using everything you’ve picked up on everything you come across. This is standard adventure game fare, but I found for some reason this game was a bit more confusing to “get the hang of” - possibly due to the interface feeling so different than typical Sierra Online or LucasArts style games.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dreamweb/scummvm-dreamweb-cd-00027.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Trying to figure out where to go next may seem challenging, but once you’ve given yourself a chance to get used to the controls and the flow of this game, it actually progresses in a very linear fashion. Ryan will call out new information in a very obvious way, and traveling to new locations is just a matter of going outside and selecting from the list of available locations.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dreamweb/scummvm-dreamweb-cd-00033.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>From the travel screen you can cycle through all available locations, as well as get information about each by clicking the note icon in the upper right hand side of the screen. As you move around the game world and inspect everything and talk to everyone, you’ll slowly learn various door codes and network logins and passwords. You’ll need these to be able to explore all key locations as well as progress the story.</p>

<p>Navigating the network unfortunately can be a bit confusing.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dreamweb/scummvm-dreamweb-cd-00021.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are only a couple of commands you actually need to use and these are documented in the manual under the <em>“The Network Monitor”</em> section. The manual sort of hints at you needing to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOGON RYAN</code> to get started, and that you’ll need a password. If you read the material that comes with the game, the last page of the diary has your network password.</p>

<p>You’ll find various cartridges scattered throughout the game, which you can put into these network monitors and explore. Some of them require you to use a different login to access the contents, which you’ll find by exploring.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dreamweb/scummvm-dreamweb-cd-00023.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Almost everything can be picked up and carried with you, but you have very limited inventory space. Fortunately if you need to drop anything it will remain visible on the screen in case you need to come back later and pick it back up.</p>

<p>This is actually an important mechanic in this game as more than once you’ll find yourself needing to pick things up and immediately drop them because something might be hidden underneath. Because your inventory is limited to 30 slots, you’ll want to make sure you carefully select what you do and don’t carry around with you.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dreamweb/scummvm-dreamweb-cd-00039.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Overall I genuinely enjoyed playing this game. It’s extremely dark and almost has a cyberpunk type of feel to it, especially once you finally finish the game only to realize your reward is being returned to your life to face the consequences of your actions. This results in a standoff with the police where they ultimately kill you, releasing your aura back to the Dreamweb for the cycle to begin again.</p>

<p>The ambient music playing throughout enhances the “Blade Runner”-esque nature of the game, though you’re not chasing replicants here. I actually felt like DreamWeb would make a good addition to the cyberpunk genre along with titles like <a href="/blog/2016/02/23/just-finished-shadowrun/">Shadowrun</a>, <a href="/blog/2023/02/13/rise-of-the-dragon/">Rise of the Dragon</a> or <a href="/blog/2023/02/18/manhunter-new-york/">Manhunter: New York</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dreamweb/scummvm-dreamweb-cd-00040.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In October 2012, the creators and copyright holders of DreamWeb, Creative Reality and Neil Dodwell, released the game as freeware for use with ScummVM. It is available for download from <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/games/#games-dreamweb:dreamweb">their Downloads page</a>. Unlike the version <a href="http://www.textfiles.com/piracy/RAZOR/dream.nfo">cracked by Razor1911</a>, the freeware version includes the copy protection (guessing the pattern at the alter near the endgame) as well as the network logon passwords.</p>

<p>Though extremely linear in nature, this game can be pretty challenging. You’ll likely need a walkthrough to get through the Network Monitor stuff unless you’re taking an extremely methodical and thorough approach to your playthrough.</p>

<p>DreamWeb wasn’t well received critically when it was released, but I think it’s actually a very good entry in the pantheon of adventure games - and not one to miss. If you’re a fan of more mature darker stories and are willing to do the work up front to read through the supporting material I think you’ll really enjoy this gaming experience.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Ventura:_The_CD-Rom_Game">Ace Ventura: The CD-Rom Game</a> is an adventure game released for the PC based on the animated series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Ventura:_Pet_Detective_(TV_series)">Ace Ventura: Pet Detective</a>.</p>

<p>The game is a classic point and click adventure game that resembles the tone of the Leisure Suit Larry series by Sierra Games, in that it approaches the adult style of humor featured, which is implied but never shown, all while remaining faithful to the family-friendly tone established in the corresponding animated series broadcasting at the time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ace/krnl386_025.png" alt="" />
<em>Windows 3.x technically ran on DOS … so why not DOSBox</em></p>

<p>Part of the fun (and challenge) of writing this series is getting some of these old games to work at all. I thought I was clever and could get this game working using a virtual machine but after trying with Windows 3.x, 95, 98 and eventually Windows 7 I kept running into issues with speed, sync and random crashes. I took some inspiration from what they’re doing at <a href="https://collectionchamber.blogspot.com/p/adventure.html">The Collection Chamber</a> and got this up and running using DOSBox by first installing Windows 3.11.</p>

<p>This worked like a charm, and by using <a href="https://dosbox-x.com/">DOSBox-X</a> I could even take advantage of CPU speed hacks and save states. The latter were less relevant as this game saves your progress anytime you exit the game - but still better safe than sorry.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ace/krnl386_003.png" alt="" />
<em>I dig the cartoony art style of this game. It’s likely true to the cartoon it’s based on</em></p>

<p>You play as Ace Ventura, the Pet Detective - but not the one from the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109040/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_6_nm_2_q_ace%2520ventura">movie of the same name</a>. This game is based off the animated series that I never knew existed. I guess this came out as I was aging out of Saturday morning cartoons, but it’s kind of interesting to know that one of the writers on that show was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_MacFarlane">Seth MacFarlane</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ace/krnl386_006.png" alt="" />
<em>So many stupid minigames</em></p>

<p>Though there’s a weak plot underlying this game, you’re basically just moving from one minigame to the next. For example, after you leave your apartment the first time, you end up underwater trying to get onto a sub through the garbage shute - which you have to swim up. While doing this you have to avoid garbage while collecting oxygen. Later you have to build a totem pole with random parts, then keep a whale centered on sonar, then jump from moving whale to moving whale … etc. None of these are particularly fun, but at least they’re typically short.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ace/krnl386_010.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Like most adventure games you have to randomly hunt for items to help you solve certain puzzles. There really isn’t all that much to collect in this game and the things you can interact with are pretty obvious. If you try to use the wrong items together or interact with anything but the <em>exact thing</em> Ace is supposed to focus on on any particular screen you just get a generic “Nope. Can’t do it” type of response, so finding the correct targets is easy.</p>

<p>One item combination puzzle is almost insanely nonsensical, though it makes a bit of sense in retrospect. When you get to your apartment the second time you find out the landlord has cut your power, so to use your computer you need to attach a cable from the tv to the fuse box, attach the other end to the tub, fill the tub with water, pick up some electric eels, pick up some rubber gloves, grab the eels with the gloves and drop them in the tub. Easy right???</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ace/krnl386_031.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Solving the product ordering puzzle was also a bit obtuse. I ended up leaning on the walkthrough for the majority of the endgame just because things weren’t making sense anymore. It’s not that they were hard - just - confusing. Maybe if I had a bit more patience I could have worked my though these naturally but honestly after a couple hours plugging away at these puzzles and mini games I was just getting frustrated and the story progression wasn’t keeping me engaged.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ace/krnl386_033.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Eventually you get to the castle in Bavaria - because that’s where Phatteus Lardass’ lair is. Yeah, you’re reading that right … I’m sure 16 year old me would be laughing his ass off at this, but it just gets an eye roll at this point. Anyway, a couple of simple puzzles and one overly complex pattern matching puzzle later and you get to the stage where Lardass is shooting you with a laser. Avoid this long enough and he “brings the house down” literally, and that’s the end of the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ace/krnl386_039.png" alt="" />
<em>Look at that - you saved the animals! I guess that was the goal of the game?</em></p>

<p>I used to love this type of comedy - and Ace Ventura specifically, so this game made me feel old. I guess the fact that I could remember how to install Windows 3.11 without needing to resort to instructions because I’d done it a few times over the years also made me feel old. Honestly, that part was more fun than this game, so thanks Ace Ventura for giving me that experience at least.</p>

<p>Overall experience here was pretty lackluster. There’s really nothing notable about the background music or sound effects, and though the art style is expectedly cartoonish, most ot the game is just static backgrounds. There’s very little to interact with and you’re kind of left to fill in the gaps in the story yourself. Maybe these are pulled from episodes of the TV show, and if I’d watched it the game might have made more sense.</p>

<p>If it weren’t in the list for this series there’s no reason I’d ever have played this game, and honestly wouldn’t recommend it to anyone else.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_on_the_Mississippi">Murder on the Mississippi</a> is a 1986 detective adventure game developed and published by Activision for the Commodore 64, Commodore 128 and the Apple II computers, where you assume the role of Sir Charles Foxworth and must solve a murder mystery on the luxury ship “Delta Princess”. The story is based loosely on the Agatha Christie novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_on_the_Nile">Death on the Nile</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/motm/vice-screen-2023050306364137.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When playing these earlier PC games it’s important to call out what they did right, and where they may have been innovative. This game starts off with some theme music and an animated introduction, the sets the stage for our character’s journey. Once you’re in your cabin and gain control of Sir Charles, you have an opportunity to move around and get acquainted with the controls.</p>

<p>You leave your cabin and start walking around, testing doors and learning how to navigate the ship. Eventually you’ll make your way from cabin #3 (your home cabin) to the other side of the ship and cabin #4. Once inside you discover a murder has taken place and it’s crime solving time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/motm/vice-screen-2023050306430613.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Unlike most verb-based adventure games, Murder on the Mississippi offers you only a handful of options on every screen. These options will change depending on whether there’s an NPC on screen or not, but ultimately you can always <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WALK AROUND</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INSPECT</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EXAMINE EVIDENCE</code>. Inspecting the environment is contextual, so you need to be “near” something that you can interact with (such as a table, cabinet, etc).</p>

<p>If you’re lucky, there may be a clue hidden in, around, behind or under whatever you happen to be inspecting.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/motm/vice-screen-2023050406284738.png" alt="" />
<em>Well look at that, there was a key under the pillow!</em></p>

<p>The ship contains 28 locations you can investigate (27 cabins and the wheelhouse where the captain is). Though this may seem like a lot, there are really only a handful of cabins that contain anything notable, and the cast of characters you can interact with is actually pretty small.</p>

<p>Since this is a murder mystery, interacting with characters to piece together their stories is a big part of the game. I found the approach they took here to be pretty clever, though it may not have been intuitive.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/motm/vice-screen-2023050407043564.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Every character you meet gives you the option to ask them about either (a) the victim, or (b) any other character you’ve already met. For each of these interactions you’re able to “take notes”, which involves moving the cursor over each word in their response and forming a sentence you may want to use when speaking to other characters.</p>

<p>This mechanic is clever, but actually extremely hard to get right. The thing is, you can ask characters about the victim as many times as you want, but you can only ask them about other characters once. If you forget to take notes, or you take the <em>wrong</em> note - you’re fucked.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/motm/vice-screen-2023051006082619.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you collect these notes, you can share them with other characters. This is how you advance the plot - assuming you wrote the write thing down in the first place. Incorrect notes give you a generic response, which sucks because you have no idea that you’re on the right track but asked the wrong thing.</p>

<p>I used a walkthrough for this portion so I’m not sure if it would have worked to just copy the entire response as the note (like copy literally everything every character said).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/motm/vice-screen-2023050406484155.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you find clues you’ll periodically have to go back to your cabin to stow them in the steamer trunk. This is both because your sidekick (Regis) can only carry so many items. Within the steamer trunk you’re able to examine individual items, or combine them by placing two items on the examination table and selecting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EXAMINE</code>.</p>

<p>There are a number of clues you can combine, and I’d highly recommend you examine everything (and all combinations) more than once. For example, once you unlock the rosewood box with the key and find what’s inside, examining it a second time reveals a false bottom with more clues in it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/motm/vice-screen-2023051006190505.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When you’re finally satisfied that you’ve solved the murder, the last thing to do is go to the character’s cabin you think is guilty and accuse them. This results in the characters being gathered together, a long exchange between all of them and Sir Charles and hopefully a confession from the killer.</p>

<p>Overall I found this game to be pretty well paced and engaging. There are a couple places where you can die because the killer has set traps that you’ll need to avoid and these will catch you by surprise the first time - so save A LOT. Similarly every time I wanted to ask a character about what another character was saying I’d save before taking notes in case what I noted ended up not getting a response.</p>

<p>The note taking/sharing was interesting but ultimately frustrating as it’s so easy to get wrong. Thankfully there weren’t too many combinations you of note and characters, and it became increasingly easy to determine when characters weren’t sharing anything noteworthy (so you could skip taking notes on those responses).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/motm/vice-screen-2023051006232817.png" alt="" />
<em>If all goes well you make it to New Orleans</em></p>

<p>I didn’t think I was going to like this game, but in the end I really did. The music is pretty simple - but it’s there. Every character has their own tune that plays when you enter their cabin, there’s background music as you walk around the ship and you get occasional sound effects as you bump into things as you investigate.</p>

<p>Murder on the Mississippi is not a great game, but I had a good time working through the mystery and eventually finding the killer. Though you literally have to investigate EVERYTHING to try and surface clues where there’s no indication anything might exist, the game is still pretty short and can be enjoyable (unless you’re <a href="https://originalnews.nico/372062">this Japanese gamer that spent 2 years making a strategy guide to clear the game</a>).</p>

This can result in increased latency when measuring the time to response of an operation following a cold start, so it’s worth understanding what the anatomy of an authenticated connection is - as well as what can be done to improve an initial operations round trip time (RTT).</p>

<h1 id="current-state">Current State</h1>

<p><img src="/images/mongo-auth-01.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="connection-protocol">Connection Protocol</h2>

<p>Typically a MongoDB connection string will contain a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#std-label-connections-standard-connection-string-format">standard seed list</a>, which is represented by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongodb://</code> protocol followed by a list of servers (ex: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongodb://localhost:27017,localhost:27018....</code>).</p>

<p>Starting with MongoDB 3.6 instead of having to provide the seed list in the connection string manually a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#std-label-connections-dns-seedlist">DNS-constructed seed list</a> could be used as well. With this configuration the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongodb+srv://</code> protocol is used to communicate both the seed list as well as any options by performing two (2) DNS queries to resolve the following DNS records: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV_record"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SRV</code></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TXT_record"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TXT</code></a>.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-3-6-here-to-srv-you-with-easier-replica-set-connections"><em>“MongoDB 3.6: Here to SRV you with easier replica set connections”</em></a> for more information regarding this topic.</p>

<p>Additionally there may be an RTT for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AAAA</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CNAME</code> resolution, however these may be done in parallel and may also be cached. <a href="https://www.cloudns.net/blog/dns-cache-explained/">DNS Caching</a> will likely improve the performance of these queries, but it’s worth noting their presence within the connection establishment and authentication lifecycle.</p>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that if the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SRV</code> record returns multiple hosts, those <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AAAA</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CNAME</code> records will be resolved in parallel. And DNS servers typically will optimize the traversal returning any intermediate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CNAME</code>s followed by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AAAA</code> in the same request.</p>

<p>This also assumes UDP-based DNS resolution. If you exceed the UDP packet size, you might first try UDP, receive an error, and retry using TCP (and possibly requiring a TCP handshake to the DNS server as well).</p>

<h2 id="tcp-handshake">TCP Handshake</h2>

<p>Once a host is known from the seed list, next we need to connect to it. This is done using a standard <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-3-way-handshake-process/">TCP 3-way Handshake</a>, which constitutes 1 RTT. Note that as there is an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ACK</code> sent following the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SYN/ACK</code> this handshake is sometimes considered to be <a href="https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/a/76369">1.5 RTT</a>, however most TCP stacks will send the first data packet with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ACK</code>.</p>

<h2 id="mongodb-handshake">MongoDB Handshake</h2>

<p>Now that we have established a TLS secured TCP socket connection to a MongoDB host (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongos</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongod</code>), the MongoDB Driver will send a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/hello/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello</code></a> command to perform <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/mongodb-handshake/handshake.rst">the initial handshake</a>.</p>

<p>This step is required to determine that the host at the other end of the socket is actually a MongoDB server. Assuming the version of the MongoDB Driver supports MongoDB 4.4+ the handshake will also include a <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/mongodb-handshake/handshake.rst#speculative-authentication"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">speculativeAuthenticate</code></a> argument. Specifying this argument to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello</code> will speculatively include the first command of an authentication handshake, thus eliminating one round trip as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">saslStart</code> command doesn’t need to be sent during the authentication handshake.</p>

<h2 id="authentication-handshake">Authentication Handshake</h2>

<p>MongoDB supports a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Authentication_and_Security_Layer">SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer)</a> mechanisms. By default the SASL mechanism that will be used will be a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/security-scram/">SCRAM</a> mechanism (either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-1</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-256</code>), which effectively means “username and password”. Note that this is a “challenge response” mechanism, so these credentials aren’t broadcast in the clear.</p>

<p>As outlined in the <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/auth/auth.rst#id8">MongoDB Authentication specification</a>, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-256</code> conversation will be made up of 2 round trips as follows:</p>

<p>MongoDB 4.4 has been out since at least <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/4.4/#4.4.1---sep-9--2020">September 2020</a>, so chances are most applications are connecting to at least this version or newer. This would put the average round trip count for authenticating a connection between 6 and 9 (depending on what protocol is being used and if DNS results were previously cached).</p>

<p>Next let’s review what can be done to reduce these round trips where possible.</p>

<h2 id="use-x509-authentication">Use x.509 Authentication</h2>

<p>When using <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/configure-x509-client-authentication/">x.509 certificates to authenticate clients</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/auth/auth.rst/#mongodb-x509">conversation</a> with the server does not require a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">saslContinue</code>. Assuming this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">speculativeAuthenticate</code> of the initial handshake succeeds (which it should), two full round trip can be removed!</p>

<p>Note there’s no authentication round trips as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">speculativeAuthenticate</code> succeeding contains the information typically sent via the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">saslStart</code> command.</p>

<p>TLS 1.3 (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446">RFC 8446</a>) can authenticate a connection approximately twice as fast as TLS 1.2 (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5246">RFC 5246</a>) by eliminating a full round trip.</p>

<p>Though not necessarily supported (at time of writing) by the MongoDB Server, additional non-standard TLS 1.3 configurations can further help speed up encrypted connections - such as <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2016/06/15/building-a-faster-and-more-secure-web-with-tcp-fast-open-tls-false-start-and-tls-1-3/">TLS false start</a> and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-0-rtt/">Zero Round Trip Time (0-RTT)</a>.

<p>In some environments (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_as_a_service">Function as a Service</a>) the cold start time of an application is critically important. The time to authenticate a connection to a MongoDB host and how this can be improved can be useful in improving operational latency of applications.</p>

<p>Out of the box there may be upwards of 9 network round trips (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SRV+TCP+TLS+MONGODB+AUTH</code>), however this can potentially be cut in half (or more) by understanding what configuration and authentication options exist and how they can be applied.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="MongoDB" /><category term="mongodb" /><category term="connections" /><category term="drivers" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[When MongoDB Drivers establish a connection with a MongoDB cluster a number of network round trips are performed.

<p>As a Product Manager, data is everything when it comes to making decisions. One of my responsibilities as a PM for Developer Interfaces is to understand how our developer communities work most effectively, and what their preferred tooling and stacks look like.</p>

<p>When focusing on the Ruby developer community, a simple question to ask would be <em>“What is your favourite editor/IDE when working with Ruby / Rails?”</em> JetBrains’ developer survey from 2021 found that <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2021/ruby/#Ruby_what-editor-ide-do-you-mostly-use-for-ruby-development">48% of Ruby developers mostly use RubyMine</a> - which may be accurate - but the survey was run by the vendor responsible for RubyMine and may have skewed results based on their sample group consisting of fans/customers/users of their products.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>I wanted to try running my own survey to see if the responses align with what JetBrains found. Since my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/12yjgwh/favorite_editoride_when_working_with_ruby_rails/">Reddit survey</a> was conducted 2 years after JetBrains’ how have things changed?</p>

<p>This was my first time running a Reddit poll, but found the community to be extremely engaged and willing to provide honest and targeted feedback. I only setup the poll to run for 72 hours, but during that time period I received:</p>

<ul>
  <li>931 Votes</li>
  <li>20K Total Views</li>
  <li>50 Upvotes</li>
  <li>41 Comments</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately Reddit doesn’t appear to consistently present engagement statistics (views, upvotes) so this is an approximation based on observation during the period the poll was open.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>The poll contained 6 options (the maximum Reddit allows) and was open from 2023-04-25 to 2023-04-28.</p>

<pre><code class="language-mermaid">pie title Favourite Editors for Working with Ruby/Rails

  "Visual Studio Code": 418
  "Vim/Neovim": 145
  "SublimeText": 62
  "Emacs": 25
  "Other": 37
</code></pre>

<p>Based on feedback I’d received in the comments I updated <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> to also include <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a>, however I’d have preferred to keep these options separate.</p>

<p>The fact that <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> was almost half of the poll’s respondents favourite editor wasn’t surprising, however over a quarter still favoured <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine</a>. This is far less that what JetBrains found, but my sample size is much smaller and audience potentially more diverse. Still the size of the user base for RubyMine is large enough that it should not be discounted when developing strategies when discussing developer tooling for Ruby specifically!</p>

<p>Also minor fun fact since the topic here is Ruby developer tooling. This blog is built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and the chart above was created using <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/">Mermaid</a> and a script similar to the <a href="https://github.com/jasonbellamy/jekyll-mermaid">jekyll-mermaid</a> plugin using a code block like the one below:</p>

<p>The main IDEs/Editors currently favoured by the users I polled were Visual Studio Code, Neovim and RubyMine. I had an entry in the poll of <em>“Other”</em>, which I believe (based on the comments) is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://macromates.com/">Textmate</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/atom">Atom</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Developers also seem to prefer editors that support <a href="https://solargraph.org/">Solargraph</a> for Intellisense.</p>

<p><strong>Is Reddit a good platform for this type of exercise</strong></p>

<p>Depending on the community/subreddit you choose to run the poll in your mileage may vary. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/">r/rails</a> subreddit has 57K users, so the chances of getting decent engagement were moderate, and given that I only ran this poll for 3 days I feel the response rate was quite high.</p>

<p>I will definitely use this method again in the future.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>When promoting this poll I posted to LinkedIn and Twitter only. Some of the feedback I got alluded to Reddit potentially discouraging some participation as users may not have accounts and may not want to create an account just to vote in a poll. Further to this, Reddit limits the number of items you can include in your poll to 6 items and it seems <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/hach42/why_is_there_a_6choice_poll_limit/">this is by design and won’t be increased any time soon</a>.</p>

<p>Being able to capture feedback from participants without there being a barrier to entry (like creating an account on Reddit) may improve engagement, however there is definite value in targeting a poll directly to the community represented in a subreddit.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Product Management" /><category term="survey" /><category term="ruby" /><category term="rails" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cross posted to DEV]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.alexbevi.com/images/ruby-banner.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.alexbevi.com/images/ruby-banner.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Mission Asteroid (On-Line Systems) - 1980</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2023/04/26/mission-asteroid/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mission Asteroid (On-Line Systems) - 1980" /><published>2023-04-26T20:27:47-04:00</published><updated>2023-06-07T06:05:53-04:00</updated><id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2023/04/26/mission-asteroid</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2023/04/26/mission-asteroid/"><![CDATA[<blockquote class="prompt-info">

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Asteroid">Mission Asteroid</a> is a graphic adventure game for the Apple II written by Ken and Roberta Williams and released in 1980 by On-Line Systems. It was later ported to the Atari 8-bit family and Commodore 64.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/asteroid/screenshot-2023-April-26-19-57-13.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You’re not really introduced to the game in any way other than being plopped from the title screen to the first playable screen, but apparently an asteroid is on a collision course with the earth, and you play as an astronaut tasked with flying to the asteroid and blowing it up before it’s too late.</p>

<p>I don’t want to say the plot of the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armageddon_(1998_film)">Armageddon</a> was <em>very loosely</em> based on this game (because I have zero evidence to back this up), but I want to believe it’s possible …</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/asteroid/screenshot-2023-April-26-20-03-35.png" alt="" />
<em>The graphics may not be great … but at least it’s not JUST text on screen right?</em></p>

<p>For a game released in 1980, the graphics actually aren’t too bad - though the character portraits really look like they were drawn by a child. Seeing as these early games weren’t using bitmap graphics but vector-ish graphics as each scene is “drawn” from coordinate details, I’m guessing their tooling was limited and this was the best of the best at that time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/asteroid/screenshot-2023-April-26-20-18-43.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/">ScummVM</a> supports all these <a href="https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/ADL">ADL engine</a> games, I chose to play the Apple II version on <a href="https://paleotronic.com/software/microm8/">microM8</a> just to give myself an excuse to try out a new emulator. I play a lot of these games on an old MacBook Pro, and my go to for emulating Apple II games was <a href="https://github.com/AppleWin/AppleWin">AppleWin</a>, so it’s good to know I have a viable alternative for OSX now.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/asteroid/screenshot-2023-April-26-20-17-18.png" alt="" />
<em>Ah shit, I <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PUSH</code>ed the throttle instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PULL</code>ing it … and now I’m dead</em></p>

<p>It wouldn’t be a Sierra On-Line game without you being able to fuck up and die by typing the wrong command, and Mission Asteroid is no different. There really aren’t that many game screens to explore so your chances of messing up are pretty slim - but they do exist.</p>

<p>As with any of these early adventure games, save early and save often.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/asteroid/screenshot-2023-April-26-20-24-48.png" alt="" />
<em>Ken and Roberta thank you for saving the planet!</em></p>

<p>This game was promoted as an entry level game to get players used to these types of adventure games, so you can forgive the simplicity. There’s no real character or plot development, no music and I don’t think there were really any sound effects.</p>

<p>If you’re just starting out with adventure games I highly doubt you’d be going back <em>this far</em> as your entry point into the genre, but if you do this is a pretty easy game to get you going.</p>
