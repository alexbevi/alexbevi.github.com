<p>In <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/t/mongoserverselectionerror-c83200000a000152-ssl-routinesunsafe-legacy-renegotiation-disabled/262568">this community forum post</a> there was a report of the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/">MongoDB Node.js driver</a> failing to connect with the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MongoServerSelectionError: C8320000:error:0A000152:SSL routines:final_renegotiate:unsafe legacy renegotiation disabled:c:\ws\deps\openssl\openssl\ssl\statem\extensions.c:922</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This error doesn’t smell like a MongoDB-specific error, so digging into <em>“<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">final_renegotiate:unsafe legacy renegotiation disabled</code>“</em> specifically lead to <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/21296">this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openssl</code> issue</a> that looks to elaborate on the meaning of the error message:</p>

<blockquote class="prompt-info">
  <p>TLSv1.2 (and earlier) support the concept of renegotiation. In 2009 (i.e. after the TLSv1.2 RFC was published), a flaw was discovered with how renegotiation works that could lead to an attack. After the attack was discovered a fix was deployed to all TLS libraries. In order for the fixed version of renegotiation to work both the client and the server need to support it.</p>

  <p>The original (unfixed) version of renegotiation is known as “unsafe legacy renegotiation” in OpenSSL. The fixed version is known as “secure renegotiation”. So either a peer does not have the fix, in which case it will be using <em>“unsafe legacy renegotiation”</em>, or it does have the fix in which case it will be using <em>“secure renegotiation”</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it seems that the error originated from OpenSSL, and “that flaw” they’re alluding to was likely <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2009-3555">CVE-2009-3555</a>. What was particularly interesting about this issue is that it <em>only</em> occurred when the application was run using Node.js 20, while Node.js 16 didn’t exhibit any issues - so what’s different between those two versions? One notable change is that <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/openssl-november-2022">Node.js 17+ use OpenSSL 3.0 by default</a> - and starting with 3.0 <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/15127">secure negotiation support is required by default</a>.</p>

<p>For more information on secure server-side renegotiation I’d highly recommend <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/discussions/21747">this discussion</a>.</p>

<p>A similar issue was reported on Stack Overflow for the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">axios</code> library</a>, and the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/74600467/195509">solution</a> there was to pass <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">secureOptions: crypto.constants.SSL_OP_LEGACY_SERVER_CONNECT</code> during request creation. As <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">secureOptions</code> is an option passed to Node’s <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tlscreatesecurecontextoptions"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tls.createSecureContext</code></a> API (which MongoDB <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/fundamentals/connection/tls/#securecontext-example">documents an example of using</a>) it should be possible to do something similar with the Node.js driver.</p>

<p>SUCCESS! The above example allows a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SecureContext</code> object to be created with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">secureOptions</code> selected from the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#openssl-options">enumerated OpenSSL options Node.js has defined</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="prompt-tip">
  <p>Though the Node.js driver allows direct configuration of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SecureContext</code> object, as other <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/">MongoDB drivers</a> <em>may not</em>, <a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DRIVERS-2823">DRIVERS-2823</a> is being considered to ensure this type of configuration is available.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="alternative-configuration">Alternative Configuration</h2>

<p>Configuring the MongoDB Node.js driver’s OpenSSL options directly is likely the preferred approach, but the Node runtime can also be configured (via <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--openssl-configfile"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--openssl-config=file</code></a>). In this, when the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">node</code> process is executed the path to a custom OpenSSL configuration file could be provided as follows:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>node <span class="nt">--openssl-config</span><span class="o">=</span>/path/to/openssl.conf
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openssl.conf</code> is setup similar to the example below:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innocent_Until_Caught">Innocent Until Caught</a> is a graphic adventure game with an icon-based point-and-click interface.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iuc/innocent_004.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Jack T. Ladd is a thief, his hunting-ground is the whole galaxy, and at the moment, he’s in big trouble. He’s got 28 days to pay his taxes - or else the interstellar tax agency will hunt him down. Termination is a viable punishment for tax offenders in these days, you know. Stranded blank on the barren, run-down planet Tayte, Jack decides that he has to make some cash. Quick.</p>

<p>Innocent Until Caught is pretty standard in terms of design but introduces some innovations when it comes to the interface. It features a mini-window at the bottom left of the screen which is alternately a mini-map of the area (showing all exits) and a looking glass for detecting small items. The inventory is a box-window in which objects can be placed wherever player wants (even on top of others). Also, the plot is illustrated by a few rendered sequences, some of the first used in adventure games.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<em>Not too shabby looking for a cutscene from 1993</em></p>

<p>From the minute I started playing this game I got <a href="/blog/2023/02/10/beneath-a-steel-sky/">Beneath a Steel Sky</a> vibes. I didn’t realize that game came out a year later, so maybe I should be saying the reverse, but regardless of semantics Innocent Until Caught struck a tone with me. I am a huge sucker for games that seem to take place in either a post-apocalyptic future, a dystopian future or a cyberpunk setting.</p>

<p>This game is set in a dystopian future, but right away you’re treated to the comedic undertones that highlight the entire plot. It doesn’t take much of a stretch to envision this game having been written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Lowe">Al Lowe</a> as the backdrop for a slightly darker Leisure Suit Larry adventure.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iuc/innocent_021.png" alt="" />
<em>You know you wanna know what happens next …</em></p>

<p>Innocent Until Caught offers a pretty straightforward interface, though it overloads each interface area to perform double-duty. The bottom left area is a mini-map, however when you’re <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code>ing at something it will tell you what you’re hovering over. The mini-map also shows all exits to the current screen you can follow, which can be clicked on if you have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WALK</code> selected.</p>

<p>The middle area is your action/verb bar as well as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">STATUS</code> button. The status area gives you details about your progress and is where you can find save/load and configuration options.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iuc/innocent_033.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Your status screen also shows a profile of Jack T. Ladd which serves absolutely no purpose until the very end of the game, at which point you can use this to change your clothes to impersonate a guard.</p>

<p>Inventory management and item combinations are a massive part of this game. The third status area of the user interface which takes up about 2/3 of the screen is the inventory. There are just so many items you can pick up throughout this game - and I’m pretty sure ALL of them are required to progress.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iuc/innocent_016.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If there’s one thing I have to gripe about when it comes to this game it’s the <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=moon%20logic">moon logic</a> you need to apply to certain puzzles and item combinations. If you thought <a href="https://musingsofanitpickinggirl.wordpress.com/2018/10/15/can-we-talk-about-the-monkey-wrench-puzzle/">Monkey Island’s “Monkey Wrench”</a> puzzle was obtuse, wait until you get a load of this game.</p>

<p>Need to break into a bank? Get the plans for it from the bank first, then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">USE</code> those plans in the sewer to find your way to an alcove that shows where the wall is the weakest. To get through that wall you’ll need to blow a hole in it. Put a mushroom in front of the alcove, then release a fly that will fly into the mushroom causing it to explode. How do you catch that fly? First find a jar and a lid (make sure to combine them when you find them). How do you get the fly in the jar? Fill it with mayonnaise of course!</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iuc/innocent_018.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Fly flies into the mushroom and BOOM goes the wall. Well that was easy … right?</p>

<p>I’m assuming there must have been some conversational hint or observation when you <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INSPECT</code> something somewhere because I read through the <a href="http://www.replacementdocs.com/download.php?view.6546">manual</a> and didn’t find any mention of the fly … or a mushroom. The manual does give you a couple clues to some of these puzzles though like <em>“Try to find an alternative way to enter the zoo. When you do, how you smell might mean the difference between life and death.”</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iuc/innocent_001.raw1.png" alt="" />
<em>Yet another feat of mental gymnastics will be required to get past this monster</em></p>

<p>Though the puzzles can be ridiculously difficult to solve, the game as a whole is pretty forgiving. I didn’t die once - not did I find myself in an unwinnable situation. I don’t actually know if it’s possible to do either of these as I’m assuming the game just doesn’t let you advance until you have all the necessary items to progress past the area you’re trying to get to.</p>

<p>I leaned on the walkthrough pretty heavily during this playthrough so I’m not 100% sure if this is the case, but whenever I tried to put Jack in danger the game just sort of told me “you can’t do that”.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iuc/innocent_017.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When you’re not scanning every inch of every screen to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SEE</code> if there’s an item to pick up, you can progress the plot by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TALK</code>ing to most characters. These interactions take place in a conversation view where you typically have 3 options you can choose from in any situation. You can also inspect what you’re being told to pull out keywords from a conversation to ask more about this (the cursor will turn to a question mark when you find a keyword in a response).</p>

<p>I only used this once or twice during the game so it’s not a major mechanic, but it does add some variety to these interactions.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iuc/innocent_023.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The writing in this game is excellent, and it’s worth noting that the themes and dialogue of Innocent Until Caught are not for kids. I think this actually drew me in more as it felt like a more mature game and it gave the writers more leeway to inject adult humour and themes throughout.</p>

<p>I was very much sucked into this game world and enjoyed <em>most</em> of the experience … but then you try to break out of jail.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iuc/innocent_024.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The jailbreak sequence involves navigating a maze. I HATE MAZES. This was just unnecessarily drawn out because there’s nothing to do but grind your way through using trial and error until you muddle your way to the end. I’m sure there are people that genuinely enjoy mazes, but I’m not one of those people so I call them out whenever I encounter them (as I did with <a href="/blog/2023/09/06/manhunter-san-francisco/">Manhunter 2: San Francisco</a>, <a href="/blog/2023/05/31/return-to-ringworld/">Return to Ringworld</a> and <a href="/blog/2023/11/24/the-legend-of-kyrandia/">The Legend of Kyrandia: Fables and Fiends</a>).</p>

<p>Thankfully this is only one sequence and you can burn through it in about 20-30 minutes (depending on how much backtracking you have to do).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iuc/innocent_013.png" alt="" />
<em>If you’re unable to board the train, you’re using DOSBox and your CPU cycles are below 6000</em></p>

<p>The majority of the initial act of the game takes place in 5 different areas which are accessible by subway. Once you visit each area (by waiting for the subway to get there) you’ll be able to “fast travel” by getting on the subway at any stop, looking at the subway map and just clicking the stop you want to go to. This is EXTREMELY convenient as it allows you to bypass the drawn out subway ride between stops.</p>

<p>One issue I had with the subway was that I found myself unable to progress the first time I played this game. Every time the subway car would stop and open the doors I clicked like a maniac to get Jack to board the train cycling through every verb/action available … but nothing worked. It turns out that this is a known (but poorly documented) issue you’ll run into if playing the game via DOSBox.</p>

<p>If you want to avoid the frustration, start the game as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Launch DOSBox</li>
  <li>Increase the <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/wiki/Performance#CPU_Cycles_.28speed_up.2Fslow_down.29">CPU cycles</a> beyond 6000 (default is 3000)</li>
  <li>Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INNOCENT.EXE</code> to start the game</li>
</ol>

<p>You can now board the train successfully. You have to follow this sequence as increasing the cycles once the game is already running doesn’t seem to work. Once you’ve done the above you can restore a game right before you board the train and you should board successfully.</p>

<p>Note that you <em>can’t</em> change your audio configuration and then load a save state. If you do so the audio just won’t work and you’ll have to play the rest of the game in silence. This was a bit frustrating as I wanted to play through using either the Soundblaster or Roland configuration … but I started with Adlib so that’s what I rolled with.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/iuc/innocent_020.png" alt="" />
<em>The game does give you A LOT of clues as to what you may need to do next</em></p>

<p>The music is atmospheric and appropriate - though limited. There are a handful of background songs that the game will cycle through based on the screen you’re on, and the samples are pretty short so you’ll notice the looping. This is a pretty minor complaint though as the songs are pretty good.</p>

<p>Aside from some technical challenges and a maze that I could have done without, this game came as a pleasant surprise. I’ve heard of it numerous times over the years but never took the time to try it out myself - but I’m really glad I did.</p>

<p>Since there’s a sequel (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilty_(video_game)">Guilty</a>) that came out a couple years later I’m now looking forward to when I get to tackle that title as well.</p>

<p>I’d recommend this game, though you’ll likely need a walkthrough to solve some of the puzzles. Do yourself a favour though and setup your preferred audio device before you start the game ;)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniac_Mansion:_Day_of_the_Tentacle">Day of the Tentacle</a> is a 1993 graphic adventure game developed and published by LucasArts and is the sequel to the 1987 game Maniac Mansion. The plot follows Bernard Bernoulli and his friends Hoagie and Laverne as they attempt to stop the evil Purple Tentacle - a sentient, disembodied tentacle - from taking over the world.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dott/scummvm-tentacle-00000.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Day of the Tentacle is a point-and-click adventure game and a sequel to Maniac Mansion. The player controls Bernard, and later also Hoagie and Laverne, being able to switch between them at any time. By using the commands at the bottom of the screen, the character can pick up items, use them on other things, talk to people, and more. Any of the three friends can also send his items across time to another friend.</p>

<p>The game takes place in the same area, but in three different eras, and thus affecting history takes a vital part in some puzzles. For instance, Hoagie can hide an item in the 18th century, and Laverne discovers it in the 23rd century - but by then, the item may have been affected by time and changed its properties.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dott/scummvm-tentacle-00005.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I’m not going to try to hide it - Day of the Tentacle is probably one of my favourite adventure games of all time. Though it can take 6-8 hours to finish without a walkthrough, I’ve played through it enough times that I was able to burn through it in about 45-50 minutes for this article.</p>

<p>Though I’ve played it countless times, from the moment you boot it up and the title sequence starts your attention is immediately grabbed and you are sucked into this weird world where tentacles can move around and talk. If you haven’t played Maniac Mansion the existence of the tentacles won’t really make any sense (I think it’s elaborated on there), but it’s not really all that important to the advancement of the plot.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dott/scummvm-tentacle-00008.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you gain control of Bernard you’ll have a short sequence that encourages you to explore a single room until you realize you can open the clock to find Dr. Fred’s secret lab in the basement. I think this is meant to be a sort of tutorial sequence to get players used to the verbs available (bottom left) and the inventory system (bottom right).</p>

<p>Since this is a game from 1993 the interface and layout was pretty intuitive, so I appreciate that you could quickly progress beyond the scripted sequence, meet the other two characters you’d eventually be able to control and advance the plot to the time travel subplot.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dott/scummvm-tentacle-00019.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The two characters that accompany Bernard on this adventure weren’t present in Maniac Mansion - though Hoagie seems to be a cross between <a href="http://www.maniacmansionfan.50webs.com/characters.html">Jeff and Razor</a>. Hoagie finds himself sent back in time where he gets to meet the founding fathers, and Laverne is shot into the future.</p>

<p>A large part of the games mechanics is to make changes in the past to create changes in the future. For example, as soon as the Cron-O-John sends everyone their separate ways Laverne lands in a tree and gets stuck. You only get access to Hoagie and Bernard as a result as you can’t actually use Laverne until she’s free.</p>

<p>To solve this puzzle you need to get rid of that tree - but this needs to be done in the past.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dott/scummvm-tentacle-00015.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Hoagie strikes up a conversation with George Washington and challenges him to see if he’s “still got it” when it comes to chopping down cherry trees. If you’re not an American (I’m not) knowing this is the solution to a puzzle might be a bit confusing, but the game only gives you so many dialogue options so it’s not that hard to figure out (also, apparently <a href="https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/cherry-tree-myth/">this was a myth</a>).</p>

<p>You paint the fruit on the tree red, talk to Washington, he chops the tree down and Laverne is free!</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dott/scummvm-tentacle-00026.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Dr. Fred’s relatives can be found throughout the time periods and they’ll help advance the story. Your goal is to recharge the Cron-O-John in each time period and get back to the present to stop the Purple Tentacle. You’ll do this though myriad fetch quests and item puzzles.</p>

<p>Need a vacuum in the future - put a flyer in the suggestion box in the past that says all basements must have vacuums. Need a hamster in the future - put one in the ice box in the present and then thaw him out in the future and give him a sweater to warm him up.</p>

<p>Though a little contrived, these puzzles are typically pretty straightforward and the game gives you plenty of clues as to how they need to be solved.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dott/scummvm-tentacle-00022.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though I love this game it’s important to note it’s not perfect. The voice acting can be rough to listen to at times, but the writing is so good you’ll likely let this one slide. There are a handful of characters you can interact with, but most of them offer extremely limited conversation trees and typically exist as a barrier between you and some item you need for some puzzle.</p>

<p>The solution to certain puzzles requires you to be aware of certain concepts that a child likely wouldn’t understand. The notion that <em>“it always rains right after I was my car”</em> is needed to solve a puzzle in the past, but this is not something a child would be aware of and would result in the puzzle being unnecessarily complex. I played this game for the first time when I was 14 and I seem to remember getting past this just based on in-game clues, but the cause and effect of washing the carriage resulting in rain made zero sense to me then.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dott/scummvm-tentacle-00031.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Day of the Tentacle is an extremely approachable adventure game for new players to the genre. It has the right mix of humor to keep the plot progression enjoyable, is well structured and balanced and doesn’t contain dead ends or unwinnable scenarios.</p>

<p>A really cool easter egg you can find is that the original Maniac Mansion game is hidden on the computer in Ed’s room. Just clicking <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code> on the computer will allow you to play though the entire game if you want - though this didn’t work for me during this playthough. When I tried to play the embedded Maniac Mansion my instance of ScummVM crashed:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>Assertion failed: (endP &gt;= beginP), function BaseString, file str-base.cpp, line 118.
[1]    22698 abort      scummvm
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I ended up have to restart from the beginning because I didn’t save my game once … oops. I also filed this with the ScummVM team as <a href="https://bugs.scummvm.org/ticket/14892"><em>#14892 - DOTT: Crash when trying to play MM on Ed’s computer</em></a>.</p>

<p>If it were possible to play more games in this series or in this universe I’d be all in, but unfortunately it doesn’t look like this will be the case anytime soon. As a result, if you haven’t played Day of the Tentacle I’d highly recommend either the original version or picking up the <a href="https://www.gog.com/index.php/en/game/day_of_the_tentacle_remastered">remastered version on GOG</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tass_Times_in_Tonetown">Tass Times in Tonetown</a> is an adventure game published by Activision in 1986. It was designed by Michael Berlyn and Muffy McClung Berlyn and programmed by Rebecca Heineman of Interplay (credited as Bill Heineman) in cooperation with Brainwave Creations.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/tass/SCR-20231223-tbqh.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Your grandfather has invented a device which makes real everything he can see in his dream. All the strange places and creatures he can dream about really exist in an alternate reality. One of those creatures, named Franklin Snarl, traveled through the device to our reality and kidnapped Gramps, teleporting him into the crazy world of Tonetown. He hopes that Gramps will always remain asleep, which assures Snarl’s own existence!</p>

<p>Now it’s up to you, the hero of the game to travel to the alternate dimension of Tonetown and to rescue your grandfather. You interact with the environment by either typing in commands, or choosing one of the action icons available as interface. The game, therefore, combines text-based interaction with the more modern “point and click” approach.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<em>Would you consider this dude “tass”?</em></p>

<p>In the fall of 1986, Apple debuted the final computer in their Apple II line, the Apple IIgs. “GS” stood for graphics and sound, and Apple needed an impressive launch title to demonstrate the machine’s new multimedia capabilities. For this, they turned to a quirky new game published by Activision and developed by Interplay, Tass Times in Tonetown, which became the first game commercially available for the Apple IIgs.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/tass/SCR-20231223-tfhh.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game’s opening location, an abandoned cabin, provides players a non-threatening area to familiarize themselves with its unique controls. The upper-left quadrant of the screen shows pictures of the player’s location. The pictures are mostly static, but occasionally contain simple animations. To the right of those pictures are a series of clickable “command icons” which act as shortcuts to common commands such as GET, DROP, and LOOK AT. Separating the screen horizontally is a strip that displays the player’s inventory, and a compass that can be used for navigation. The bottom portion of the screen displays detailed text descriptions and has a prompt for typing commands. The pictures and text descriptions aren’t always in sync; for example, characters are frequently mentioned in the text that don’t appear in the graphics. To find every object, players will need to scour both the graphics and the accompanying text.</p>

<p>After exploring grandfather’s cabin, players will quickly discover something is missing: grandfather. Behind a locked door, players find one of Gramps’ inventions — a magical hoop that doubles as a portal to Tonetown, a crazy, futuristic world full of people with wild haircuts and radical clothes who hang out in totally tubular locations. Everyone in Tonetown speaks in totally tass slang, a combination of Valley Girl slang and made up future babble. Denizens of Tonetown wear hooplets, strive to look Troppo, talk on floatfones, and use guitar picks for currency.<sup id="fnref:2:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>For a launch title released for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIGS">Apple IIGS</a> I have to say I’m pretty impressed with both the graphics and sound - which is what the “GS” is IIGS stands for - so I guess that’s hardly a surprise. Though there were ports to multiple platforms, I chose to play through the original IIGS release as this gave me a chance to try out <a href="https://apple2.gs/plus/">GSPLUS</a> - an emulator I’ve never had an opportunity to dig into.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/tass/SCR-20231228-hnaq.png" alt="" />
<em>GSPLUS disk image configuration screen</em></p>

<p>Getting the game up and running just involved getting the emulator started (you’ll need a <a href="https://archive.org/details/Apple_II_GS_TOSEC_2012_04_23">2GS ROM set</a> first), then configured point your s5d1/d2 disk drives to the images for your game. Once set and saved, quit and restart GSPLUS and it should boot directly to the game.</p>

<p>This took me a bit of trial and error which is why I wanted to share it in the article. Having an excuse to fiddle around with some lesser known systems and emulators without having to resort to <a href="https://www.retroarch.com/">RetroArch</a> is a big part fo the fun for me when navigating this series.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/tass/SCR-20231223-tcll.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After reading through the game’s <a href="https://retro-commodore.eu/files/downloads/amigamanuals-xiik.net/Games/Tass%20Times%20in%20Tonetown%20-%20Manual-ENG.pdf">manual</a> you get a brief synopsis of the game you’re about to play - but it’s really not super clear:</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/tass/SCR-20231228-hrmf.png" alt="" />
<em>Are you tass? Are you tone? What’s “tass” or “tone” mean???</em></p>

<p>The description above actually does outline what your objective is for the game, though in the most obtuse and cryptic way imaginable. Once you boot up the disk images, you’ll find yourself in an empty cabin where the game begins. This area acts as a good training ground to get you used to the text parser, the buttons that act as shortcuts for certain verbs and the scene window.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/tass/SCR-20231227-rmge.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can click on the verb buttons to pre-fill the text parser, or you can click on the picture window to also prefill the parser. This is actually pretty novel for 1986 as it makes the game a lot more approachable - especially when you need to interact with a character and you don’t know their name. You can just click on them and fill in the rest.</p>

<p>The game will also show you inventory items on the screen that you can pick up. You have a limited number of inventory slots so you’ll need to leave items behind periodically to make sure you don’t run out of room. When you drop an item it will be visible on the screen, so next time you come back it’s obvious that you have left something here.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/tass/SCR-20231227-rkua.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Like any good retro text-based adventure game, it is VERY easy to die. Most puzzles only have a single solution, and require you to complete a series of fetch quests to complete. Unfortunately this game can also leave you in unwinnable situations if you forget to pick up certain items. For example, the book you can pick up in the cabin before you enter the hoop - if you leave it behind you cannot win the game, and there’s no way to go back to pick it up.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/tass/SCR-20231227-sbuc.png" alt="" />
<em>Game over. Something about animals and evil or something …</em></p>

<p>Though the puzzles can be a bit frustrating as it’s not usually obvious <em>what</em> you need to do to progress in this game, there is so little you can interact with and so few screens to navigate it’s not all that difficult to brute-force your way through. The game gives you multiple save slots, so you can easily save every few screens, look at everything, pick up everything, buy everything and wear everything.</p>

<p>Eventually you’ll find Gramps, save him from an island fortress, take him to Snarl’s and push Snarl back through the hoop. This sets everything back to normal and the game ends there.</p>

<p>Since I didn’t have an Apple II (or GS) as a kid I was never exposed to this game, so I have no hidden fondness for it. It looks and sounds pretty good for what it is, and the game engine (called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ADVENT</code> in the about screen, but apparently also <a href="https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Mindshadow">Mindshadow</a>) was used for a couple other games of that era.</p>

<p>This game has a bit of a cyberpunk feel to it, but in the opposite way. Though it’s futuristic and “punky”, everything is extremely bright, upbeat and vibrant. I honestly really enjoyed the aesthetic, even if the story itself didn’t really resonate with me.</p>

<p>If you enjoy parser-based adventure games this is not a bad entry and is quite approachable. The music is better than I expected, the visuals are better than I expected - but the gameplay was a bit boring.</p>

<p>Since I want to upload these videos to YouTube for the team to review, I need a single video file. After hunting around for scripts that could do this for me, I did find a few that looked promising - such as <a href="https://github.com/scuc/GoPro-Concat-Automation">GoPro-Concat-Automation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/KonradIT/gopro-linu">gopro-linux</a>. Ultimately I wanted to be able to just do this myself with a single command, so though these tools got me most of the way there, I ended up opting for my own script instead:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

<p>This uses <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a> to concatenate the videos and copy them to a new file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">output.mp4</code>. The input list for the videos is just a bash command to generate a list of MP4 files with the full path to the file in chronological order by create date.</p>

<p>Note that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">safe</code> mode is disabled (see <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-formats.html#Options"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ffmpeg</code> options</a>) as having it enabled can result in the video creation failing for file-naming reasons. Why is this enabled by default and not disabled you might ask … <a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/5558">#5558 <em>concat protocol should run in “-safe 0” mode by default</em></a> has more info on that topic.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="video" /><category term="ffmpeg" /><category term="video" /><category term="scripting" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a HERO10 Black that I use to record video from my kids hockey games (such as this one), but since I typically move around with the camera between periods, the videos end up being “chaptered”, or multiple single videos.

However, a series of gruesome murders perpetrated by a sinister cult known as “The Kindred” shocks the city. Marie becomes a victim of their attack and falls into a coma. It becomes Sonny’s very personal mission to track down the attackers and make them pay for their crimes.</p>

<p>The Kindred is the third installment of the Police Quest series, its events taking place after those described in <a href="/blog/2023/02/21/police-quest-2/">Police Quest II: The Vengeance</a>. The game brings back some of the elements of the first game, such as a modified version of driving sequences and police procedures unrelated to the main plot the protagonist must go through. Computer work is particularly emphasized, requiring the player to perform tasks such as using facial composite software or figuring out murder patterns by studying a map. Like other Sierra adventures of the time, the game uses an icon-based interface for interaction with the environment.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00002.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Sonny has been promoted following the events of Police Quest II, and the game starts off with you giving a briefing to the other detectives to kick things off. There are multiple narrative threads in this title which gives it some additional depth, and you dive right into one of them as soon as the game starts. Detective Pat Morales has apparently got a complaint lodged against her for use of abusive language. Since these games are effectively police procedure simulators, you’re going to need to start off by interviewing her, then deciding what to do about said complaint and file the appropriate paperwork.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00005.png" alt="" />
<em>Picking the wrong option when filing paperwork can lead to a game over</em></p>

<p>Following the proper protocol at all times is a requirement to being successful in any Police Quest game, and luckily for you these protocols are well documented in the game’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/Police_Quest_3_-_Manual">manual</a>. There are all sorts of procedures outlined here such as how to handle felony situations, obtaining entry into private property, courtroom procedures and forceful entry into dwellings. If it’s in the manual, you’re likely going to need to do it at some point in the game so it’s not a bad idea to do the reading up front so you know what you’re dealing with.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00013.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Detective Morales will prove to be a pain in your ass throughout the game. Once you find your way downstairs on the first day and get into the squad car you’ll have to drive out to observe a failure to sign, as the driver that the detective pulled over doesn’t want to sign a citation because the officer was being rude. Yup … it’s Morales again.</p>

<p>This is another segment of the game where you’re presented with a couple options as to how you can respond, and if you pick the wrong one - it’s game over. You can send the pregnant woman to jail (which is what Detective Morales suggests), but doing so gets the department sued for $1 million and you lose your job (game over).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00041.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Being a Sierra game, expect almost every decision you make to potentially result in death. This actually makes the game a little easier to complete as exercising good game save hygiene will allow you to trial-and-error your way through most scenarios. Just save, try something, fail, reload, try the other option and move along … rinse and repeat.</p>

<p>You’ll still need to pay attention and take notes though - especially when characters mention things like case numbers, serial numbers and addresses.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00028.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There’s a computer you’ll need to use to look up case details or search for items by serial number. These pieces of information are typically mentioned during conversations with other characters and may only be referenced once. If you miss a case number when the chief is briefing you, it may not be available again and you’ll have to reload a previous save and repeat the conversation to get that piece of information (or use a walkthrough).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00032.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The computer is actually used for a number of scenarios in this game. My favourite is the scene where you bring a homeless woman back to the office because she claims she saw someone suspicious and wants to describe them to you. Instead of a police artist generating a composite image based on her description, you use the computer to generate a face based on her prompts. This is actually kind of fun and breaks up some of the monotony of police procedure.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00026.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Along with the ongoing issues with Detective Morales (who ends up being assigned as your partner on Day 2) is the subplot involving the attempted murder of your wife. Mary is stabbed in the parking lot of the mall, and your captain knows you won’t rest until the case is solved so he assigns it to you to investigate.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00039.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Investigating the case involves a lot of driving back and forth between locations and the police station. The tedious manual driving from <a href="/blog/2022/03/15/police-quest-1/">Police Quest: In Pursuit of the Death Angel</a> is back, but this time without any visual differentiation on the map (as the VGA remake of PQ1 provided). You just drive in a direction and wait for the road signs to tell you where you are - and if you’re approaching a location.</p>

<p>I did not enjoy this at all. It honestly felt like filler most of the time and was there to slow you down.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00021.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You’ll have to deal with a handful of highway patrol scenarios early on, which aren’t too difficult but require you to drive back and forth until the relevant event triggers. You’ll also have to drive back and forth to various locations and the police station to advance the story as the game progresses. There is a lot of driving in this game, and honestly I would have appreciated a “fast travel” type of option near the end …</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00046.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The locations you drive to will require investigation, and this involves more police procedure (properly collecting and handling evidence). You have a field kit in the trunk of your car that you need to open and take everything out of each time you visit a crime scene. Once you collect and bag evidence you need to return the field kit items back to the kit before you can leave the scene. This just seems like something they could have automated for you, as it artificially delays you from progressing to get a message like “You can’t get into the car until you return the field kit items to their respective slots in the kit”, or something like that.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00023.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After each scene you will either return to the police station or the hospital. If you go back to the station you’ll either be booking a perpetrator (if you arrested someone) or booking evidence. When booking evidence you’ll need to enter the case number the evidence belongs to, so make sure you’ve taken note of these. If you book a perp, you’ll need to provide the correct booking code. These are all in the manual, so you just need to make sure you pick the right one (it’s not that hard).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00037.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The subplot about your wife actually leads into a thread about multiple murders that have some kind of occult ties to them. You’ll need to keep track of the locations of these murders as there’s a final segment on the computer where you need to plot the crimes on a map of the city and draw a pattern to try to tie them together. Assuming you do this correctly you’ll draw a pentagram that will give you the location of the final crime scene.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00044.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It’ll come as no surprise that Detective Morales is tied up in all of this (there are signs throughout the game). The game also manages to link the series antagonist (Jesse Bains) to this game as well by introducing his brother near the end as being affiliated with one of the perpetrators you were trying to hunt down.</p>

<p>Though I may not love the driving in this game and find it overused, the strong story more than makes up for it. This is no surprise as the game was written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Jensen">Jane Jensen</a>, who would also go on to write <a href="/blog/2023/06/14/gabriel-knight-sins-of-the-fathers/">Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers</a>, so you know you’re in for some twists and turns and a sprinkling of the occult.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00051.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I have very fond memories of this game, and I really enjoyed going back to it - but it’s not as good as I remembered. Though there are a lot of digitized sound effects, and occasionally there is background music most of the time you just have generic background noise. The driving segments of the game are overused and just make everything feel slower as a result.</p>

<p>You do get to use the gun near the end of the game (exactly twice), but it’s not really obvious either time that this is necessary until you die and are prompted that maybe you should be “more prepared” next time.</p>

<p>Although I did find some aspects of this game entertaining, overall I was just trying to get to the end so that I could move on. If not for the strong story I would probably recommend skipping this game, but if you’ve played the first 2 entries in the series you might as experience the conclusion of Sonny Bonds’ story arc.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Crystal_(video_game)">The Dark Crystal</a> is a graphic adventure game based on Jim Henson’s 1982 fantasy film, The Dark Crystal. The game was designed by Roberta Williams and was the first Hi-Res Adventure directly released under the SierraVenture label in 1983.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dark/scummvm-hires6-apple2-00004.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Dark Crystal is closely based on Jim Henson’s film of the same name. The game is set in Thra, a world with three suns, which come together every thousand years in an event known as “The Great Conjunction”. The player controls Jen, the last survivor of the Gelfings, a race of mole-like people. He must find a dark crystal and its broken shard, and repair it to end the reign of a tyrannical lord.</p>

<p>Like other installments of the Hi-Res Adventures series, the game is entirely text-based, with non-animated graphics to illustrate the areas. Movement between areas and interaction with the game world is performed by typing commands consisting of either one or two words (a combination of a verb and an object).<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dark/scummvm-hires6-apple2-00010.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You interact with the game world via the text parser. Though the verb/noun combinations you need to identify to progress from screen to screen are pretty easy to figure out, I did find myself getting stuck on occasion when the game expected an obtuse sequence of commands. Navigation is handled by going in a direction (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EAST</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NORTH</code>) and typically when you enter a new screen (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code> at it) everything you need to know or interact with is called out pretty clearly.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dark/scummvm-hires6-apple2-00019.png" alt="" />
<em>This screen took me forever to get past</em></p>

<p>This game follows the plot of the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Crystal">The Dark Crystal</a>, so I’m guessing if you’re a fan - or have seen it recently - maybe some of these puzzles would make a bit more sense. There is one section where you need to get into the castle where the solution is to get <a href="https://darkcrystal.fandom.com/wiki/Fizzgig_(Character)">Fizzgig</a> to climb through the bars of a door to get a key that’s on the other side.</p>

<p>On the surface this type of puzzle isn’t really challenging, but up to this point in the game you have not had to interact with a multi-part prompt where you issue multiple commands with <em>no feedback</em> after entering the first. You have to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SEND FIZZGIG</code> through the bars, but when you send him it just says something like “Where?”. The response is then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SEND BARS</code> (or maybe just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BARS</code>) but if you do this wrong you have to start over and it’s not clear you were even on the right track to begin with.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dark/scummvm-hires6-apple2-00015.png" alt="" />
<em>Oh look, I’ve died again</em></p>

<p>Being such an early adventure game I’m ok with slightly obtuse puzzles, and being a Sierra game, I expect death around every corner. And you will die on most screens.</p>

<p>Though there isn’t any music throughout the game and limited sound effects, the scene drawing for a game released in 1983 really isn’t that bad. My main complaint would be that there are so few colours presented that it’s basically monochrome, but this is likely due to the Apple II only having 6 colors to choose from (Ken Williams would enhance the ADL interpreter to support dithering and expand that palette to 21 colours<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dark/scummvm-hires6-apple2-00023.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are a handful of items you can pick up and use throughout the game, but these are few and far between. It does vary the gameplay a little and add some depth to a couple puzzles. Unlike later Sierra titles you won’t find yourself overwhelmed with options, and every item you pick up is almost immediately useful, so try everything you pick up on the screen you found it!</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dark/scummvm-hires6-apple2-00025.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The movie this game is based on isn’t something I have fond memories of (or really any memory of), so playing through this game doesn’t really stir up any nostalgia. I’m sure it follows the plot pretty closely, and if you enjoyed the movie you’ll likely enjoy the game.</p>

<p>For a very early graphical adventure game it’s definitely well done and really shows off the power of the ADL engine. If you’re an interactive fiction fan you’ll likely enjoy this experience, but otherwise this one’s probably not worth playing through.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_(video_game)">Frederik Pohl’s Gateway</a> is a 1992 interactive fiction video game released by Legend Entertainment, and written by Glen Dahlgren and Mike Verdu. It is based on Frederik Pohl’s Heechee universe.</p>

<p>When humans finally managed to colonize the planet Venus, they discovered a gigantic system of artificial underground tunnels there. It is assumed that a highly advanced alien race known as Heechee has constructed those tunnels thousands of years ago. Eventually, an abandoned, yet fully functional Heechee spaceship is discovered. One of the explorers boards it, which leads humanity towards the discovery of a space station with many similar ships - all with coordinates of unknown planets already punched in. This station becomes known as the Gateway, being humanity’s only connecting point to the rest of the universe.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gate/gate_021.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Since traveling to the potentially dangerous destinations involves a great deal of risk, only some particularly courageous (or perhaps reckless) adventurers, called “prospectors”, volunteered to go on these journeys. The protagonist of the game is one of those prospectors, having won the membership alongside a small sum of money and a one-way ticket to the Gateway. Eventually, he discovers an ancient device that contain a warning against a mysterious alien species known as Assassins - and the prospector is entrusted with the task of protecting the humans from that threat.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gate/gate_012.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Gateway is a text adventure with graphics, based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heechee_Saga">Heechee (or Gateway) saga</a> series of books.  I’ve never heard of this series, but after playing this game I’m actually sort of looking forward to reading these books. Also, as this is a book series it’s not surprising that the game involves <em>A LOT</em> of reading. This is a text adventure through and through.</p>

<p>It is identical in interface and general concept to Legend’s other text-driven adventures: the player may opt for text-only input as well as selecting verbs from a list. Clicking on objects or characters within the graphical representation of the location provides a text description. Puzzles are mostly inventory-based, though there are logic-related tasks as well. The player character explores various planets during the course of the journey. In a few cases, it is possible to die in the game.</p>

<p>The game runs on the <a href="https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Legend">Legend</a> engine, which is also used by other Legend Entertainment titles such as <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/1027/spellcasting-101-sorcerers-get-all-the-girls/">Spellcasting 101</a>, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/1026/timequest/">Timequest</a> and <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/431/eric-the-unready/">Erik the Unready</a>. There was some work done on implementing the <em>Legend</em> engine in ScummVM (see <a href="https://github.com/dreammaster/scummvm/tree/legend/engines/legend">fork for details</a>) but this work has stalled. If you’ve got some C++ chops and feel like taking a stab at continuing this work, progress is just a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git clone</code> away ;)</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gate/gate_001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game starts off with a wall of text, a handful of static screens overlaid with more text, then you get dropped into the game world where you’re presented with a whole lot more text. I personally love text adventures, but if this is not your jam … you may not like this game.</p>

<p>It’s actually worth calling out how much of this game involves massive walls of text and expository dumps. Seeing as this is based on a book (or series of books) AND it’s a text adventure none of this should be a surprise … but it’s still a LOT of reading.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gate/gate_039.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are some characters you can interact with, which will change the view to show you a different view where that character dumps more narrative on you. As you’d expect by now, this will involve a lot more reading as … you guessed it … another wall of text is coming your way, but presented a little bit differently just to mix things up a bit.</p>

<p>The game has a MIDI soundtrack with a handful of looping samples, and though there is a “viewport” on each screen that draws the current scene, this isn’t really required. You can switch to a pure text rendition of the game via the UI if you so choose, which just gives you more space to read what the games throwing at you in great, great detail.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gate/gate_050.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though it may sound like I’m dumping on the massive amount of reading this game forces you to do, I actually quite like it. The game’s interface is extremely intuitive, and makes it fairly straightforward to determine what actions you can take on what screens, as well as what direction(s) you can move. There is a column of verbs you can click on (if you so choose), which when selected present you with what modifiers the verb expects, then another column of nouns that you can interact with.</p>

<p>If you pay attention and actually read all the text that’s being thrown your way, progressing through the game isn’t overly difficult.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gate/gate_055.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>What IS difficult (or at least frutstrating) is that there are a number of interactions in the game that require repeating the same action multiple times. For example, digging out the ore requires you to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DIG ROCK</code> twice, but this isn’t obvious based on the feedback the game gives you when you do it the first time.</p>

<p>The second frustration would be the sheer volume of puzzles that require you to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WAIT</code> on a specific screen until a certain time for an event to be triggered. Typically the game will tell you where you need to be and at what time, but occasionally you’ll have to just keep typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WAIT</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WAIT UNTIL HH:MM</code> to force a longer wait until a fixed time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gate/gate_061.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I personally really dislike these types of puzzles in adventure games, as it feels like artificial padding. If you want me to hide in a box and wait for someone to come in and do something I’ll observe, make the act of hiding in the box be the event trigger …</p>

<p>The story is split into 3 parts, with each being self contained but building on the events of the last part. For part 1 you’re introduced to the world, including the lore and background on the Gateway and the Heechee. You learn about exploring space as a prospector and how the game expects you to proceed. You’ll eventually join the Orion program and discover that humanity is in peril and only you can save them. You visit planets, activate these pillar things on each and that does …. something.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gate/gate_043.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you activate four of these monuments you find out you’ve alerted the big baddy who’s going to wipe out all of humanity - unless you stop them. This takes place inside a simulation or an AI or something, and involves solving more puzzles in some weird settings (like a random cocktail party, then hell).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gate/gate_066.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though you’re typically not in any danger for most of the game, you can die in certain situations. Thankfully it’s really easy to save and restore here (it’s just another command) so it’s worth saving early and ofter. I found myself saving, then mashing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WAIT</code> on many screens just to see if it would trigger something to change. If it didn’t, I’d just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RESTORE</code> my last save and try something different.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gate/gate_071.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This game uses a similar engine to <a href="/blog/2023/05/23/companions-of-xanth/">Companions of Xanth</a>, but I’m guessing a much earlier version. Overall I actually really enjoyed playing through this title, and found it was reminiscent of some of my favourite menu-driven adventure games such as <a href="/blog/2021/08/16/shadowgate/">Shadowgate</a> or <a href="/blog/2021/08/15/princess-tomato-in-the-salad-kingdom/">Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom</a>.</p>

<p>The story is engaging, and though there’s a lot of exposition, you find yourself carefully reading everything that everyone says as the world that is being described is really interesting and immersive. I found myself having to use a walkthrough many times as I likely missed details I shouldn’t have glossed over, or I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time and had some <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WAIT</code>ing to do …</p>

<p>Gateway isn’t a game you’re going to play for the graphics, the sound effects or the music. If this was released by Sierra in 1982 you wouldn’t have been disappointed, and for adventure game fans that love story above all else, there’s plenty to enjoy here still.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Kyrandia">The Legend of Kyrandia: Fables and Fiends</a> (or The Legend of Kyrandia: Book One) is a 2D point-and-click adventure game, and the first game in the Fables &amp; Fiends series. It was developed by Westwood Studios and published by Virgin Games in August 1992.</p>

<p>Players take on the role of a young prince who must end the tyrannical chaos of an evil court jester in his kingdom. The game makes use of a simple interface system that allows the player to interact with objects and people, while solving various puzzles using a variety of items and special abilities.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kyra1/scummvm-kyra1-cd-1-00001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You start off with a decent cinematic sequence that introduces Kallak - a mystic - who’s also your grandfather. Your parents were murdered by the evil jester Malcolm, who shows up out of nowhere and turns Kallak to stone. He leaves a note behind that you’re supposed to show to Zanthia so she can tell you what to do next.</p>

<p>Though the characters and plot are introduced quickly and simply, it’s a bit generic here and all you know is “I’ve got item A that needs to be taken to location A” … so off we go.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kyra1/scummvm-kyra1-cd-1-00002.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Interacting with the game world is pretty straightforward and involves just clicking on everything. The cursor only changes shape to indicate a direction you can move, but if you can interact with something (or pick it up) you won’t know until you click on it. When you can pick something up, the cursor takes the shape of the thing you’ve grabbed, and you can either drop it or put it in one of the 10 inventory slots you have available.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kyra1/scummvm-kyra1-cd-1-00009.png" alt="" />
<em>The birthstone puzzle is random every time you play, so just save every time you get one right and load when you don’t</em></p>

<p>The game will remember where you drop items, so though you have limited inventory slots, it’s really not a big deal. Some of the puzzles involve trial and error so you may want to collect a bunch of duplicates of items before attempting the puzzle. For example, the birthstone puzzle involves placing gems in a specific sequence (randomized on each playthrough). If you put the wrong stone on the alter, it vanishes and if you need the same stone later, you’ll have to go find it in the forest again.</p>

<p>I picked up a bunch of duplicates before attempting this puzzle and just dropped them on the ground in front of the alter. Then as I muddled may way through the puzzle I had more than enough gems to eventually solve the sequence required to move on with the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kyra1/scummvm-kyra1-cd-1-00010.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You’ll meet Malcolm pretty early in the game, but he just sort of taunts you and leaves you alone. He’ll show up again later to delay your progress but hiding a key item you’ll then need to find, but other than that he doesn’t really pose any sort of threat to you.</p>

<p>I played through the DOS CD version of the game, so I got to “enjoy” the voice acting as a result. You can tell they swung for the fences a bit here - especially the actor that played Malcolm. It’s not the worst voice acting for this era of game … but it’s pretty bad.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kyra1/scummvm-kyra1-cd-1-00006.png" alt="" />
<em>When Brandon tells you the snake poisoned him you should probably do something about it</em></p>

<p>The puzzles in this game really aren’t that difficult, and are typically just a series of fetch quests. There are a couple of ways that you can die, so it’s important to be diligent with your save-game hygiene. I got caught off guard a couple times and found myself replaying large sections of the game because I bumbled into a death scenario accidentally.</p>

<p>Your main goal in this game is to amass magical power so that you can fight Malcolm and free Kallak from the stone spell that was cast on him. This is done by getting an amulet that displays in the lower-right portion of the screen as 4 stones. Each time you learn a spell one of these stones lights up, and if you click it you’ll cast that spell.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kyra1/scummvm-kyra1-cd-1-00017.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Seeing as you only have 4 spell slots I would have expected magic to play a larger part in the game, but it really doesn’t. Heck, the spell that turns you into a pegasus is only used once and the final spell you learn from the ghost of your mother is used twice.</p>

<p>Once you use these spells, all magic becomes unavailable, but these charge back up after a little while and you can use them again.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kyra1/scummvm-kyra1-cd-1-00011.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For me, the biggest challenge of this game was navigating the maze that is the caves. You find yourself trapped after stepping on a pressure plate, and you’ll need to go collect bricks to weigh down a counterweight to reopen the gate. This involves navigating a maze, but any time you go to a dark room you’ll be killed.</p>

<p>You find fireberries that you can pick up and drop to illuminate a room, but you can only move up to 3 rooms before the berries become ineffective. If you drop a berry it’ll keep that room lit thereafter, but you’ll need to make sure that once you run out of berries, the next room you go to contains a bush with more berries.</p>

<p><img src="https://wiki.scummvm.org/images/6/64/Kyramap2.png" alt="" />
<em>A map of the caves is super helpful</em></p>

<p>The ScummVM wiki helpfully shares a map of the caves, so I ended up using that to get through this section a bit quicker. Typically this type of spelunking involves getting 3 berries, going to one room, dropping a berry, saving, then going to the next room - rinse - repeat. If you run out of berries and die in the next room, reload and pick a different room.</p>

<p>It’s tedious, but not overly challenging.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kyra1/scummvm-kyra1-cd-1-00015.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though you’re trying to get magic spells, the second half of the game also involves mixing potions that act as single-use spells. This was just another excuse to pad the game out with backtracking fetch-quests, as mixing the potions wrong involved depleting consumable items you’d then need to go back and re-fetch to try again in a different combination.</p>

<p>I really didn’t enjoy this section as it felt forced and wasn’t really introduced meaningfully.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kyra1/scummvm-kyra1-cd-1-00022.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You’ll eventually make your way to Kyrandia castle where Malcolm is, gain the final spell, navigate another maze, solve a couple more puzzles and face off with Malcolm. The final fight is a bit anticlimactic and just involves trial and error until you land on the right spell (make yourself invisible) and stand in the right place (in front of the mirror on the right).</p>

<p>Malcolm casts the spell to turn you to stone, it bounces off the mirror and turns him to stone instead. This frees Kallak from his and you become the new king of Kyrandia. Mission accomplished!</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kyra1/scummvm-kyra1-cd-1-00024.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The first installment in the Legend of Kyrandia series is nothing groundbreaking. Some of the writing is clever and I really like the main villain, though he doesn’t really do anything during the game other than show up a couple times to delay your progress.</p>

<p>If you’re going to play this game I’d recommend ScummVM with <a href="https://docs.scummvm.org/en/v2.6.1/advanced_topics/understand_audio.html#what-is-mt-32">MT-32 device emulation</a> for the music and sound. The music is <em>much better</em> in MT-32 mode, as are a lot of the adventure games from this era that supported this audio device.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to the sequels to this game, though the initial entry didn’t really make much of an impression.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Seed_(video_game)">Dark Seed</a> is a psychological horror point-and-click adventure game developed and published by Cyberdreams in 1992. It exhibits a normal world and a dark world counterpart, which is based on artwork by H. R. Giger. It was one of the first point-and-click adventure games to use high-resolution (640 × 350 pixels) graphics, to Giger’s demand.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/start_001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You play Mike Dawson, an ad company manager who, in pursuit of his goal in life to become a writer, purchases a solitary mansion in a small town called Woodland Hills. Although the low cost and hush-hush transactions when purchasing the house do raise your suspicion, the solitary environment and sheer beauty of the house crush common sense and you decide to buy the house. That’s when the trouble begins. Upon reaching the house, you suddenly feel tired. You find a bed and fall asleep…</p>

<p>… and wake up from a terrible dream, only to find out that your life has just become a worse nightmare: an unknown source has implanted a seed of darkness in your mind, and you only have three days to find a way to stop it.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<em>Game error number 66 you say … I’m sure everything’s still fine though … right?</em></p>

<p>I have a feeling this is an issue with the environment I was playing the game in, but I could not get past the first section of the game no matter what I tried. I would go through the initial motions to take a shower and take pills, go downstairs and answer the door, go outside and pick up the package … and the game would just restart! I honestly thought this was on purpose the first few times, but when I’d go to save or load the game it showed an error message … which seemed odd.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/command_000.png" alt="" />
<em>It’s been a hot minute since I’ve busted out the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/attrib"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ATTRIB</code></a> command</em></p>

<p>After cruising the internet I stumbled on a <a href="https://www.gameboomers.com/forum/ubbthreads.php/topics/136455/dos-game-dark-seed">discussion that seemed to cover the exact issue</a> I was experiencing, and the solution was to change the properties of the installed files.</p>

<p>On the off chance anyone reads this review that has this problem, the solution is to go to the install directory for Darkseed in DOSBox and run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ATTRIB -R *.*</code> to remove the readonly attribute on the game’s files.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/start_002.png" alt="" />
<em>What a pretty doll someone sent me for some reason that isn’t suspicious at all</em></p>

<p>Once I could successfully pick up the package on Day 1, the game allowed me to progress an there were no further issues.</p>

<p>Dark Seed takes place over the course of 3 days, with each day of game time taking roughly an hour of actual time. Time and timing is a huge factor in this game - certain events only happen at certain times, and if you take too much or too little time you can miss things. This is actually extremely frustrating as there’s typically no indication that a certain event will be triggered at a specific time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/tos_009.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If it gets too late in the day Mike will decide it’s time for bed and go to sleep. Assuming you’ve done nothing about the headaches or you pass the 3 day mark, the alien embryo implanted in your brain will hatch and it’s game over.</p>

<p>Seeing as time is such a huge element of this game, it’s a bit surprising that you don’t have a default mechanism at your disposal to tell time right from the beginning. You can find a watch in the attic (hidden under a trunk you need to push out of the way), or you can backtrack to your living room and look at the grandfather clock, but I would have expected it to be a lot more prominently displayed (maybe in the main game UI).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/tos_010.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/DARK_SEED_QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD">Quick Reference Card</a> tells you you can press the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code> key at any point to advance time to the top of the next hour in case you find yourself “with lots of time to kill”. They allude to the fact you need to wait around for certain events to trigger, but not what they may be, when they’ll occur or on what screens.</p>

<p>My gameplay process (once I better understood the time mechanic) was to save the game, go to various screens and mash the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code> key a bunch of times to see if anything triggered before Mike said he was tired and it was time for bed. This would at least give me some clue as to what might be needed on that screen (and at what time). This isn’t particularly fun - but it at least helped me progress.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/tos_000.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The interface is that of a typical point-and-click game from this time period. You have your inventory at the top of the screen and a handful of interaction options you can cycle through by right-clicking the mouse. Mike can be moved around the screen, and if you mouse over a hot-spot you can cycle through various action icons like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TAKE</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">USE</code>, etc.</p>

<p>The game world is pretty small and is split into two main areas: reality, and the dark world. Reality is Mike’s house, the town and a cemetary. These make up about a dozen areas you can explore, which have a mirror version in the dark world. This is actually a pretty cool dynamic, as part of the puzzle solving process is changing things in reality to see how it changes the dark world.</p>

<p>For example, when you get thrown in jail you can stash some items under the pillow. When you find yourself in jail in the dark world, those items will be waiting for you.</p>

<p>Getting to the dark world is done by walking through the mirror in your living room. You need to fix the mirror first (it’s missing a chunk in the bottom corner that gets sent to you in the mail), but this happens pretty early in the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/tos_007.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Navigating the dark world is pretty straightforward once you realize it’s a mirror image of reality. There are some aliens you’ll need to interact with and a couple puzzles to solve, but you actually don’t have a whole lot to do here - which is a shame because it looks awesome.</p>

<p>Since the artwork was inspired by H. R. Giger’s work, everything has this Aliens vibe. The creature designs definitely have that unique Giger style, and every cutscene plays out so much better as a result.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it’s not obvious what you need to do most of the time, and it’s VERY easy to miss things and find yourself in an unwinnable situation. For example, if you enter the dark world too late in the day Mike might fall asleep on a random screen if he decides it’s bed time - and this results in you dying. The game doesn’t actually tell you that’s what’s happening though - you just randomly fall over and the game restarts.</p>

<p>Save early, save often - maintain MANY save files!</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/tos_018.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Most of the clues you get are from examining items you find along the way. They do help point you in the right direction most of the time, but this game can be pretty challenging where there are gaps in the narrative.</p>

<p>As you proceed you’ll find yourself listening to the same short music samples looping on each screen. These are very repetitive and very annoying. You spend a lot of time roaming around your house, and the house “theme” is the worst of them all. If the goal was to create a sense of “you’re going insane” - mission accomplished!</p>

<p>It’s a bit of a slog to get through this game, but thankfully it’s easy to find walkthroughs … and the game itself is pretty short.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/tos_017.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Apparently your objective was to smash the mirror in your house to sever the connection between reality and the dark world. Building the magic hammer you need to smash the mirror is the only item combination puzzle in the game, so it’s not intuitive - and also it’s not really obvious this is what you’re supposed to be doing.</p>

<p>Regardless, you make this hammer, go back to reality to start the car in the garage, go back to the dark world to launch some spaceship (that is the mirror version of the car I think), go back to reality to smash the mirror and the game is over.</p>

<p>I struggled a lot with the endgame as nothing you had to do made any sense. I tried … failed … consulted the walkthrough … and was done with it.</p>

<em>You sell your house - game over</em></p>

<p>This game had a lot of promise. I really liked the premise, and the story is actually pretty interesting but you find yourself rushing through everything because of the rigid time mechanic.</p>

<p>It’s also not a very hard game, though certain puzzles aren’t intuitive which can be frustrating.</p>

<p>Though I wouldn’t recommend this game, I can’t say I had a bad time playing it. I’m actually looking forward to the sequel (<a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/4257/dark-seed-ii/">Dark Seed II</a>) to see how they build on the initial story and if they can iron out some of the rough edges.</p>
