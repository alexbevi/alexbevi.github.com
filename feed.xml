<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper%27s_Adventures_in_Time">Pepper’s Adventures in Time</a> is an educational adventure game released in 1993 by Sierra On-Line. The project was based on a concept by Sierra VP of Development/Creative Director, Bill Davis, who also designed the game’s main characters. This was intended to be the first in a series of edutainment games in which the player, as Pepper, traveled back in time to set right mixed-up situations surrounding famous individuals.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pepper/scummvm-pepper-00000.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This point n’ click adventure game is actually an edutainment (entertainment leading to education) title developed by Sierra, who were also responsible for other games such as the EcoQuest and Dr. Brain series. The object of this game is to help a little girl called Pepper, solve puzzles based on history and logic, so that she can fix the mess caused by Dr. Fred’s time machine. At certain points in the game, the player is even allowed to control her pet dog, Lockjaw.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pepper/scummvm-pepper-00011.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game consists of an educational factor where the player can learn about many important facts concerning the colonial times of the United States. It is divided into Acts in which the player has to reach given goals and, apart from other, typical for adventure games things, learn about facts listed in the opening. To do it the special TRUTH icon has to be used. When the act is concluded, the player is challenged with a quiz about the things he learned. For each correct answer he receives progress points.</p>

<p>Cartoonish graphics similar to the style in <a href="/blog/2024/01/20/day-of-the-tentacle/">Day of the Tentacle</a> were used in order to appeal to younger audiences.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pepper/scummvm-pepper-00013.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I actually found the music in this game also reminiscent of Day of the Tentacle, however both games came out the same year so it’s possible this was just a coincidence. Unlike DOTT however, this game really isn’t all that much fun.</p>

<p>As an “edutainment” game, the gameplay elements are toned down quite a bit, so there isn’t all that much you need to do - and what there is becomes extremely repetitive.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pepper/scummvm-pepper-00004.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The plot seems to involve your uncle - who really hates Ben Franklin for some reason - building a time machine that he’ll use to go back and change the course of history … for reasons.</p>

<p>You start the game off as Pepper, and along with her dog Lockjaw get sucked into the machine and thrown back to colonial times - but when you get there it seems things are not the way you’d expect based on the history you learned in school.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pepper/scummvm-pepper-00005.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Being a Sierra SCI game you have access to the typical verb icons (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WALK</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TALK</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET</code>, etc), along with a couple that are unique to this game (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TRUTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QUIZ</code>). There are also portions of the game where you take control of Pepper’s dog Lockjaw, which gives you a different set of verbs.</p>

<p>The Lockjaw segments do actually help break up the monotony of endless fetch quests that make up the majority of this game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pepper/scummvm-pepper-00008.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can click the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TRUTH</code> icon on almost everything, and it will tell you if the thing you’re inspecting is historically accurate. This is a unique mechanic to this game that is actually sort of interesting, as a handful of these facts will be required in the quiz you have to take at the end of the chapter.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pepper/scummvm-pepper-00023.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When a fact will be included in the quiz, you’ll get points for it and the text color will be different, so it at least stands out. This is helpful as there’s SO MUCH reading in this game, and so many of the facts just sort of blend together.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pepper/scummvm-pepper-00021.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Each Act begins with a summary of the things to look out for (which correlate with the end of chapter quiz), as well as the objectives to complete the act.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QUIZ</code> icon in the menu bar will display this information at any time during the chapter, which is helpful because I found I forgot the objectives very quickly.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pepper/scummvm-pepper-00006.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Each quiz just corresponds to the clues you were given at the beginning of the chapter. If you found the associated facts while playing, the quiz itself is fairly straightforward.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pepper/scummvm-pepper-00009.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Other than clicking the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TRUTH</code> icon everywhere, you’ll also be able to talk to most characters about exactly 4 topics. There is zero variety in the gameplay when you’re playing as Pepper, which really makes this game feel like a chore.</p>

<p>Once you land in colonial times, after you are captured and escape from a storage shed your dog Lockjaw will be captured by the daughter of the main villain. After this, you can ask all characters about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ben Franklin</li>
  <li>The Pughs (the villains)</li>
  <li>Your Dog</li>
  <li>Themselves</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it. I understand this is probably more of an “entry level” game, but there’s so little to do that it just becomes repetitive and monotonous to play.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pepper/scummvm-pepper-00010.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For some reason there are hippies in the past. I guess this was the result of your Uncle’s messing with time travel - but the way these characters were written it seems the game developers really didn’t like hippies …</p>

<p>You typically have maybe 10 game screens to walk between, and every act involves many (MANY!) fetch quests. All you really do in this game is get something from point A and bring it to character B.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pepper/scummvm-pepper-00015.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Some of the fetch quests are actually fairly involved, so I’m surprised they’d have included them in a children’s edutainment game. For example, getting everything ready for Ben Franklin to recreate his Kite/Key experiment requires you to first build a leyden jar (which is described in the <a href="https://www.sierragamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Peppers_Adventures_In_Time_Manual.pdf">manual</a>).</p>

<p>Maybe I’m just not giving 90’s kids enough credit, but this was a fairly involved (and lengthy) fetch quest.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pepper/scummvm-pepper-00025.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The whole point of the game is to get your dog back from the Pugh’s, and to prove that they’ve imposed a false tax on the people of Philadelphia - which you ultimately end up doing.</p>

<p>Not having grown up in the United States I’m not really sure how meaningful or relevant this content is, but I’m guessing the characters are historically important and worth incorporating into a game to make teaching kids about them more appealing.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pepper/scummvm-pepper-00026.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>My final impression of this game is “I just don’t get it”. None of this was fun, and advancing the plot felt like work.</p>

<p>If you find this period of American history interesting though there’s quite a bit you’d be able to learn by revisiting the game and just clicking everything with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TRUTH</code> icon. The writing can be clever in places, but some of the jokes and commentary don’t really seem appropriate for a younger audience - so I’m not really sure who this game was made for.</p>

<p>In one scene in the mansion with Lockjaw I was able to crash ScummVM, by biting Pugh, then sniffing the powder on the desk then grabbing the key - but I couldn’t reproduce it consistently so didn’t file a bug report.</p>

<p>Since this is a Sierra game, you could find yourself in game-over territory fairly frequently, but instead of just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RESTORE</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RESTART</code> options, you could also <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TRY AGAIN</code>. This made slogging through this game a bit more bearable as it took you back to right before you made the wrong choice.</p>

A Journey into Adventure Games (1980-1999)”</a>, I found myself wanting a better way to handle navigation between posts. The existing Jekyll plugins and tutorials I found (such as those from <a href="https://digitaldrummerj.me/blogging-on-github-part-13-creating-an-article-series/">Justin James</a> and <a href="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/jekyll-post-series-links/">Steven Marks</a>) provided some inspiration but didn’t fully align with my use case.</p>

<p>The plugin I decided I wanted to build would need to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dynamic generation of navigation links based on the series’ metadata.</li>
  <li>Simple and intuitive integration with Jekyll’s existing templating system.</li>
  <li>Robust error handling and graceful fallback behaviors.</li>
  <li>Ability to configure multiple series easily, ideally through <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code></li>
  <li>Easy integration with Jekyll’s <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/cache-api/">Cache API</a> to enhance build performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Leveraging my increasing comfort with AI for research and coding tasks, I turned to ChatGPT (<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6803cb78-d18c-800e-bf7e-d4e61df2c47a">full conversation here</a>). The conversational approach allowed me to iteratively specify requirements and rapidly prototype the plugin logic.</p>

<blockquote class="prompt-info">
  <p>The finished plugin is available at <a href="https://github.com/alexbevi/jekyll-series-navigation">https://github.com/alexbevi/jekyll-series-navigation</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="efficiency-of-iterating-via-chat-interface">Efficiency of Iterating via Chat Interface</h3>

<p>One of the clearest demonstrations of the value of this approach came when I encountered a cryptic error during partial rendering:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>SeriesNavTag: Error rendering nav: Liquid error: wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 2..3)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>At first, it wasn’t obvious what was causing this. But by sharing the full stack trace in ChatGPT, it became clear that the issue stemmed from how the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">replace</code> filter was being used in a Liquid template—specifically in a custom tag that was incorrectly passing a single argument.</p>

<p>ChatGPT helped narrow this down quickly by examining the stack trace and correlating it with the standard method signatures expected in Liquid’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">replace</code> filter. It then provided the correct syntax and helped walk through validating each part of the rendering process.</p>

<p>This kind of issue could have taken a long time to debug in isolation, especially because it wasn’t immediately clear whether the root cause was in Liquid syntax, plugin logic, or content metadata. With ChatGPT’s contextual understanding and ability to parse Ruby backtraces, we were able to identify and fix the bug by adjusting the argument structure in the tag rendering logic.</p>

<p>Working through the chat interface provided distinct advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Immediate Feedback</strong>: Real-time suggestions and error spotting accelerated development cycles, significantly reducing the time spent debugging. For example, ChatGPT quickly pointed out syntax issues within my Ruby and Liquid templates, helping resolve bugs in seconds rather than minutes or hours.</li>
  <li><strong>Rapid Prototyping</strong>: Instant iteration allowed for quick experiments and adjustments, enabling me to refine features continuously based on the evolving requirements. I could quickly test multiple approaches for handling metadata and caching, instantly iterating through alternative implementations.</li>
  <li><strong>Clear Explanations</strong>: Complex problems, such as issues with Liquid template variable passing, were clearly explained, improving my understanding and leading to quicker resolutions. When struggling with cache implementations, ChatGPT clearly illustrated the caching mechanism, dramatically shortening the learning curve.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since my site uses the <a href="https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy">Chirpy Jekyll Theme</a> I wanted the series navigation to seamlessly integrate, however the partial can be adapted as needed to suit your blog’s layout.</p>

<h3 id="integration-steps">Integration Steps:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Place the Ruby plugin file (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">series_nav.rb</code>) in your Jekyll site’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_plugins</code> directory.</li>
  <li>Add the Liquid partial (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">series_nav.html</code>) to your site’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_includes</code> directory.</li>
  <li>Include the plugin tag in your post or layout template with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{% series_nav %}</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ultimately, the plugin significantly streamlined navigation within my blog series, enhancing both my writing workflow and the reader’s experience. This journey underscored how AI tools can complement traditional software development, enabling faster iterations, performance optimizations, and more elegant solutions.</p>

<p>Feel free to adapt this solution to your own Jekyll blog!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Ruby" /><category term="blog" /><category term="jekyll" /><category term="ruby" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In writing my blog series, “Let’s Adventure!

I validated that <a href="https://alexbevi.com/blog/2025/03/25/cloudflare-workers-and-mongodb/">Cloudflare Workers and MongoDB</a> work together as well, but <em>how well</em> do they work together.</p>

<p>Let’s evaluate this by taking MongoDB’s simple <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/usage-examples/findOne/">“Find a Document”</a> tutorial and adapting it to a Workers environment.</p>

<blockquote class="prompt-info">
  <p>TL;DR - MongoDB works perfectly from Cloudflare Workers, but you can significantly improve request latency by using Durable Objects</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>First, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/resources/products/platform/mongodb-atlas-tutorial">create a MongoDB Atlas</a> cluster (free M0 works just fine), and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/#std-label-load-sample-data">load the sample datasets</a> once the cluster is provisioned. We’ll be using the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/sample-mflix/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sample_mflix</code></a>dataset to return some information about a movie.</p>

<p>Next we’ll want to <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/workers/get-started/first-worker/">setup a Cloudflare Worker</a>to retrieve our movie information. I personally just created the Worker via the UI the using the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/">Git integration</a> associated my worker with an existing repo.</p>

<p>The MongoDB-specific code will handle creating the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MongoClient</code>, performing all the networking and authentication round trips and retrieving a document from the cluster.</p>

<p>We’ll do some basic instrumentation to capture the time between client connection and the result being returned in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">queryTime</code>, which we’ll return as part of the response.</p>

<p>Once I had my code pushed to a repo and configured my Worker to use this repo, the CI/CD process would pick up any changes automatically.</p>

<p><img src="/images/cf/Pasted image 20250403155815.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>My Atlas cluster is in the default region - which happens to be AWS’ <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">us-east-1</code>. I’m located in Toronto, so I would expect the latency between my requests and my data to be fairly low.</p>

<p>Using the extremely scientific method of curling the workers endpoint 5-6 times and averaging the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">queryTime</code> values it seems my round trip time for an operation is 300ms, with the very first request being about 100ms slower than that.</p>

<p>I appreciate that there are <a href="https://alexbevi.com/blog/2023/05/04/round-trips-to-authenticate-a-mongodb-client-connection/">numerous round trips to required to authenticate</a> a connection to Atlas, but MongoDB’s drivers provide connection pooling out of the box so I’d sort of expect this time to go down much more - but it doesn’t.</p>

<p>Just for comparison sake since Atlas <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/amazon-aws/#std-label-amazon-aws">offers clusters in most AWS regions</a>, I spun one up in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ap-northeast-1</code> and updated the connection string in my worker to see how this might impact the round trip time of an operation.</p>

<p>These requests now take almost 2 seconds each.  Since Cloudflare Workers have a <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/smart-placement/">Smart Placement</a> feature I wanted to try that out to see if it would have any meaningful impact.</p>

<h3 id="testing-workers-and-smart-placement">Testing Workers and Smart Placement</h3>

<p>After enabling the feature, Cloudflare <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/smart-placement/#cf-placement-header">adds a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cf-placement</code> header to all requests</a> so you can pretty easily verify where your worker has been placed.</p>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I ran many tests, but my response times were always the same. Initially I thought it was an issue with the Smart Placement feature, but after reviewing with a Cloudflare team member it seems Smart Placement looks at your actual traffic patterns to determine where to place it, so I’d need traffic across many regions to trigger it.</p>

<h2 id="maintaining-state-with-durable-objects">Maintaining State with Durable Objects</h2>

<p>The nature of Workers is to provide “<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/learning/serverless/what-is-serverless/">serverless</a> execution environments”, so they’re likely stateless and would require connections to be re-created for each request. If we could create and reuse our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MongoClient</code> and associated connection pool, maybe our round trip times could be improved by reducing our cold-start times.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/developer-platform/products/durable-objects/">Durable Objects</a>  - which <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/what-are-durable-objects/">are described</a> as being a <em>“special kind of Cloudflare Worker which uniquely combines compute with storage”</em> - seem like they might be suitable for our needs. The <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/get-started/tutorial/">tutorial</a> is a great resource to get us up and running quickly, which I’ve used to adapt our previous <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MongoDBConnector</code> implementation:</p>

<p>Well that’s a heck of a lot better! Using Durable Objects we were able to get the response time down almost 10x!</p>

<p>I ran a number of tests and periodically you’d still get a cold-start spike, but most requests benefit from the reduced latency maintaining a stateful Worker via Durable Objects provides.</p>

<p>It is worth calling out that Durable Objects come with some <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/platform/limits/">limitations</a> such as a soft limit of 1,000 requests per second, but for <em>most</em> use cases this is likely sufficient. I encourage you to try this out on your own and see how it works for you.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="MongoDB" /><category term="mongodb" /><category term="drivers" /><category term="node" /><category term="nodejs" /><category term="javascript" /><category term="typescript" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cloudflare recently wrote about “Your frontend, backend, and database — now in one Cloudflare Worker”, which called out that the mongodb package should now work as expected.

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/pull/3315"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cloudflare/workerd#3315</code></a>: add node:net module</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/pull/3594"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cloudflare/workerd#3594</code></a>: implement TLSSocket and connect from node:tls</li>
</ul>

<p>Were these changes sufficient to make Cloudflare Workers and MongoDB Atlas work together? Let’s revisit the example from the previous blog post to verify:</p>

<h2 id="sample-application">Sample Application</h2>

<p>Once again, we’ll test the latest iteration of Cloudflare Workers by customizing the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/#setting-compatibility-flags">compatibility flags</a> and <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/">compatibility date</a> in our configuration:</p>

<p>To test the code above you would need to do the following:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>npm <span class="nb">install
</span>npm start
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will launch <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/">Wrangler</a>, the CLI for working with Cloudflare Workers.</p>

<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>

<p>Now that our worker is running locally, it should be accessible via http://localhost:8787. The worker logic we wrote in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wrangler.ts</code> should perform the following actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>connect to the MongoDB cluster via the connection string configured in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONGODB_URI</code> environment variable (setup in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wrangler.toml</code>)</li>
  <li>drop the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test_workers</code> collection in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test</code> database</li>
  <li>insert a new document in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test_workers</code> collection</li>
  <li>retrieve the inserted document from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test_workers</code> collection</li>
  <li>return a JSON representation of that document</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s try it out and see what happens:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>curl localhost:8787
<span class="o">{</span><span class="s2">"_id"</span>:<span class="s2">"67e2e4bb377816f2a78db326"</span>,<span class="s2">"a"</span>:<span class="s2">"2025-03-25T17:15:39.957Z"</span><span class="o">}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>SUCCESS!</p>

<p>We were able to connect to our cluster (using <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/fundamentals/authentication/mechanisms/">SCRAM authentication</a>) to interact with our data via the MongoDB Node.js driver from a Worker.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Excitement for Cloudflare Workers support for MongoDB has been around in the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/t/cloudflare-workers-integration-is-now-possible/226708">MongoDB developer forums</a> since May, 2023. As the Product Manager for MongoDB’s JavaScript developer experience I’ve possibly been making more noise about this issue than most - including the initial blog post. I shared this with the Cloudflare team in a <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/6684">bug report on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">workers-sdk</code></a>, which ultimately triggered a <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/discussions/2721">discussion on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">workerd</code> project</a> that may have prompted the ensuing engineering effort.</p>

<p>I really look forward to seeing the amazing opportunities this integration can unlock for MongoDB developers that want to take advantage of the power and flexibility of Cloudflare Workers!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="MongoDB" /><category term="mongodb" /><category term="drivers" /><category term="node" /><category term="nodejs" /><category term="javascript" /><category term="typescript" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Previously I wrote about Why Cloudflare Workers Don’t Work With MongoDB, but since then the Cloudflare team has done some great work to add support for the missing Node.js features MongoDB’s driver required to operate successfully from Cloudflare Workers:]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.alexbevi.com/images/mongodb-cloudflare.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.alexbevi.com/images/mongodb-cloudflare.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Leisure Suit Larry III: Passionate Patti in Pursuit of the Pulsating Pectorals!

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leisure_Suit_Larry_III:_Passionate_Patti_in_Pursuit_of_the_Pulsating_Pectorals">Leisure Suit Larry III: Passionate Patti in Pursuit of the Pulsating Pectorals</a> is a graphical adventure game designed by Al Lowe and published by Sierra On-Line for DOS, Atari ST and Amiga in 1989 as the third entry in their Leisure Suit Larry series.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lsl3/scummvm-lsl3-00005.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Passionate Patti in Pursuit of the Pulsating Pectorals! is the third game in Al Lowe’s Leisure Suit Larry series. Larry Laffer has finally found the woman of his dreams, and can happily live with her together on the beautiful tropical island… until he gets thrown out of the house by his wife. His boss, who happens to be his (now ex-) father-in-law, fires him. Larry is all alone, without a woman, without a job, on an island that has long ceased to be a “tropical paradise” and is exploited by entertainers, lawyers, and alike. But never despair! Dressed in his irresistible leisure suit, Larry is about to conquer the world (or at least its female population) anew. Watch out, fairer sex, because Larry is back to his swinging self!</p>

<p>The game uses the same text-based interface and the same graphical engine as the previous entry in the series. The structure of the game, however, is more similar to that of the first installment: most of the time, the player is confined to one large area which can be freely explored. Unlike the two previous Larry games, the player does not just control Larry, but also - in the second half of the game - the enigmatic and beautiful pianist Patti, helping them to reach an ending that will finally bring happiness into Larry’s life.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lsl3/scummvm-lsl3-00004.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As with any title in the Leisure Suit Larry series, this game isn’t for kids. The subject matter is mature, the jokes are crude and the themes are sexually explicit. This doesn’t detract from the experience in any way though - this is probably what drew you to this game in the first place so you know what you’re in for.</p>

<p>If you start your game by poking around the menus, one of the first options you’ll find is the expletive configuration screen. Make this anything you want - Larry won’t censor you ;)</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lsl3/scummvm-lsl3-00006.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you’ve got your favourite expletive configured, you’ll start exploring the island. It made me chuckle every time this popped up in conversation, so I have to applaud the design decision they made with this mechanic.</p>

<p>Your objective isn’t really clear, so you start roaming around the small island to see what’s available. I’m not sure if it’s clever or not, but the <a href="https://www.mocagh.org/sierra/lsl3-manual.pdf">game’s manual</a> is sort of required reading to get you started, but the way it’s presented also isn’t very clear.</p>

<p>You’ll need to read through “Nontoonyt Tonite: Your Guide to the Island” (the game manual) as it sort of lays out your objectives, and acts as copy protection as well.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lsl3/scummvm-lsl3-00010.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This game manual is the key to many of the game’s puzzles. Personally I think it’s relied upon too heavily, and some of the clues it contains are maybe too well hidden. For example, at one point you’ll need to make a grass skirt for a disguise, but in order to do this you need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>find the grass</li>
  <li>find a knife</li>
  <li>sharpen the knife</li>
  <li>cut the grass</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WEAVE GRASS INTO SKIRT</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You’re sort of lead towards that last step by the inclusion of “Native Grass Weaving Lessons” in the community calendar of the manual. Maybe that’s good puzzle design - maybe it’s too obscure - you decide.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lsl3/scummvm-lsl3-00014.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you progress you’ll meet various women that you can interact with. Each of them typically sets you up for some larger fetch quest, which on completion results in you getting to “interact” with them further (wink wink, nudge nudge).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lsl3/scummvm-lsl3-00026.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Being a text parser driven game, Larry (and later Patti) interact with the game world based on what you type in. I’ve played a lot of Sierra adventure games, and though many games can be a bit rigid as to what they’re willing to accept, I really found progressing in this game to be frustrating.</p>

<p>Many interactions just aren’t obvious. This might just be a lack of patience on my part, but I relied pretty heavily on the walkthrough while playing through this game.</p>

<p>Most of the puzzles were obtuse, and more often than not the solutions were cryptically laid out in the game manual.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lsl3/scummvm-lsl3-00018.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The goal of the game ends up being that Larry needs to find his way into the spa, figure out how to get into the locker and get himself pumped up.</p>

<p>This will enable him to hook up with the aerobics instructor, and then eventually meet up with Passionate Patti - the namesake of this game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lsl3/scummvm-lsl3-00023.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Patti and Larry will spend the night together, but Patti calls out the wrong name in her sleep. This upsets Larry, so he silently slips out of bed, gets dressed and leaves.</p>

<p>Apparently Patti is in love with Larry at this point and the mission for the rest of the game is to go find where he’s run off to.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lsl3/scummvm-lsl3-00028.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Patti portion of the game is fairly short, but immensely frustrating.</p>

<p>Once you take control of her and spot Larry (through the telescope on her balcony) heading to the far end of the island, your mission is to try and catch up to him.</p>

<p>Doing this involves navigating through a maze - which I continue to hate.</p>

<p>The solution to this maze is - you guessed it - hidden in the game manual. The lyrics to the song that is scattered throughout the manual has capitalized letters that refer to cardinal directions.</p>

<p>Stringing this together is the solution to the maze, but you can’t make it all the way through unless you remembered to pick up the bottle on wine in Patti’s room and fill it with water.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lsl3/scummvm-lsl3-00032.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you make it through the maze, you’ll need to figure out how to cross the chasm between two trees. Taking the hemp and weaving it into rope that you tie to a rock and throw over the chasm might make sense … but you’ll fall to your death every time you try to cross.</p>

<p>You’ll need to rip a chunk of your dress to build a harness that you then tie to the rope so you can cross. Who would think to do that? Maybe it was also hidden in the manual somewhere … but I reached for the walkthrough instead.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lsl3/scummvm-lsl3-00035.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once Patti makes it across the chasm and finds her way to the river, there’s a minigame you’ll be forced to play through.</p>

<p>You basically just have to veer left or right to avoid obstacles, but it takes a long time and isn’t really all that much fun.</p>

<p>I had to lower the game speed to make it through, and thankfully you can save and load your game on the river so you don’t lose too much progress every time you die … and you will die … often.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lsl3/scummvm-lsl3-00038.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The endgame is fairly straightforward … assuming you remembered to pick up the magic marker on the island before you made your way to the maze.</p>

<p>Using the magic marker sort of “warps” you to the Sierra studios, where you walk through the sets of some other games.</p>

<p>This part is actually kind of cool, and the background music represents the games you’re walking through. The final set you visit is Space Quest, which you need to float over to a plug and unplug to finish the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lsl3/scummvm-lsl3-00041.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After the final scene Larry and Patti meet Roberta Williams and she decides to have them write a game for her - so that’s where the story ends.</p>

<p>I personally like Al Lowe’s sense of humour, but I really didn’t enjoy this game. I appreciate that they tried to build a game around the manual that comes with the game, but it made for a very broken gaming experience.</p>

<p>You have to refer back to the manual way too often, and there are too many dead ends and dead man walking scenarios that require you to backtrack or restart.</p>

<p>Overall this entry in the series just wasn’t all that much fun. I am looking forward to the later entires (LSL6 and LSL7) in the series as I have much fonder memories of them.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe_(1994_video_game)">Universe</a> is a graphic adventure game developed and published by Core Design for the Amiga, Amiga CD32 and DOS platforms in 1994. It was Core Design’s second and last effort in the adventure game genre after Curse of Enchantia, of which it was originally planned to be a sequel.</p>

<p>Universe is a space opera that tells the story of Boris, a young man who has been summoned from modern Earth to another universe, where he is destined to become its long forecast savior from evil. The game received mostly positive reviews.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/006.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You are Boris Verne, a normal guy who has been cast in a parallel universe because of your uncle’s Virtual Dimension Inducer. There you’ll have to find the fabled lost star as well as a way to defeat the Golden King… This is a classic old-style adventure game with a point &amp; click interface. It uses the Rotoscope system to manage game characters and scores really beautiful 256-colour graphic.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<em>Another release from the fine folks at <a href="https://demozoo.org/productions/254430/">Prestige</a></em></p>

<p>This is the first game on my list that I’ve tackled so far that was available on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_CD32">Amiga CD32</a>, so I figured it would be worth trying to play through that version if possible.</p>

<p>I’ve been using <a href="https://dirkwhoffmann.github.io/vAmiga/">vAmiga</a> for my Amiga games, but I couldn’t get CD32 working (it’s possibly just not supported). I then tried <a href="https://fs-uae.net/">FS-UAE</a>, but didn’t have a kickstart ROM for it … so I ended up just watching a bit of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP0uQl4W8aQ">longplay on YouTube</a> just to get a sense of what’s different.</p>

<p>Seems the only difference was CD quality audio, which comes through nicely in the videos. The sound design in this game is pretty good, so even without the CD audio the ambient background music did a great job of setting the tone for each scene in the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/002.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Since the game starts off with a long intro sequence (which is also spelled out in the <a href="https://dn790003.ca.archive.org/0/items/universe-manual/Universe%20-%20Manual-DE-ENG-FR-IT.pdf">manual</a>) I sort of expected the story to take place across multiple chapters - but maybe the chapter in this case referred to the whole game and subsequent chapters would have been sequels.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/004.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After the intro you find yourself stranded all alone in space. There’s a futuristic city behind you that you can’t reach, and if you wander off in the other direction you can fall off onto a barren planet surface you can explore.</p>

<p>The game’s interface is fairly intuitive if you’ve played Point and Click Adventure games in the past, as you’ll be given a verb bar with common actions you can perform (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PICK UP</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TALK</code>, etc). There is an additional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OPTIONS</code> item that links to a submenu of actions such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">THROW</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JUMP</code>and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INSERT</code>.</p>

<p>You’ll find you actually use these additional actions a lot more that the primary actions, so you’ll be clicking through to the submenu fairly frequently.</p>

<p>This submenu also includes an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INFO</code> item which goes to a third submenu where you can save/load your game or redisplay the initial scene info. This is useful if you accidentally clicked away the description when you first entered the screen.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/010.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you figure out how to navigate the game world (including jumping to the spinning rock, then jumping back to the floating platform) and extend the bridge to the first town, you’ll be able to explore the game world a bit further.</p>

<p>Universe is visually impressive, and most scenes are extremely detailed in all their pixel-art glory. When you’re not roaming around looking for items to pick up, you’ll engage with various alien races using a fairly straightforward conversation system.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/009.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you progress through the game, there are occasionally “cut scenes” that help progress the plot. Boris will have to escape the first world and head towards the Wheelworld to learn more about the tyrannical Emperor Neiamises, the secret order of the Healers and Baron Keelev.</p>

<p>For adventure game fans, the story really takes center stage and makes the gameplay just a vehicle through which the story can unfold.</p>

<p>This game feels like it’s going to be a massive, sweeping experience as you’re playing through it, but there’s actually not all that much you need to do.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/013.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are several items you’ll need to pick up as you explore, and the game does include a few item combination style puzzles as a result. Examining most items will make it fairly apparent what you’re supposed to do with them though, so you typically won’t find yourself scratching your head for too long trying to figure out what to do next.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/038.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>One of the nice touches of Universe is the fact that the cursor will change into a thumbs up or thumbs down based on the action you just performed. Given how bad the pathfinding can be on some screens, it’s very easy to issue a command and then Boris sort of just stands there until you move a little in one direction and try again.</p>

<p>Since the cursor will change to indicate success or failure, if you try something and it works but nothing happens, you know you just need to try it again from a different position to progress.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/027.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For anyone that’s played this style of game before, it’s not overly difficult - but there are couple of arcade sequences that can be a pain in the ass.</p>

<p>On the Wheelworld you’ll meed a healer who’s had their hand stolen by thieves that take off on jetpacks. You’ll need to jump into your PTV and fly after them, shooting them down or running them into the sides of buildings.</p>

<p>It’s very easy to die in this sequence and I must have done it a dozen or so times before I finally got through it. It wasn’t fun - it was just sort of tedious.</p>

<p>I appreciate when adventure games have the self awareness to allow you to skip these sequences (like you can skip playing poker in Police Quest 1), but Universe isn’t one of those games.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/028.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When Boris dies (and he will), the game over screen makes fun of your incompetence and will occasionally give you a clue as to what you should have done instead. You can really feel the inspiration from Sierra Online here.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/041.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Like with any adventure game, save early and save often. Since I was playing the Amiga version, this mean having to eject the game disk, insert the save disk, save, eject and reinsert the game disk again. Modern gamers are so spoiled …</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/012.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are a number of planets you’ll be able to explore once you have access to a PTV. Each planet you have access requires you to go through the same motions of navigating to it, descending to it, picking a quadrant to explore, then exploring.</p>

<p>When you first get access to the map of the Universe it can feel a bit daunting, but most of the  available planets has very little to do or see. You’ll need to backtrack occasionally to solve fetch quests or after you’ve unlocked various story elements to open up new dialogue options with certain characters.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/048.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Aside from running back and forth between a handful of planets, the majority of this game’s plot advances through conversations with various characters you’ll meet along the way. Boris will slowly learn more about his place in the Universe and that he’s expected to take down the Emperor.</p>

<p>Character interactions occur via a branching dialogue system, which frequently will result in a game over if you pick the wrong options. Though having to reload can be frustrating, the feedback the game gives you when Boris dies is at least entertaining.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/039.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Universe is mostly straightforward, but the final sequences ratchet up the complexity. You’ll need to figure out how to open a portal to another dimension to retrieve a power stone. Once you find the various pieces you’ll need (on multiple planets), <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">COMBINE</code> them and use them in the right place, you’ll need to solve a puzzle.</p>

<p>This puzzle involves running over various stones to disable 6 lasers, but if you don’t do it fast enough, they reset and you start over. This took … forever. Once you are able to do it, you have to throw a rock at the power stone, then pick it up and run so you’re not immediately captured by a bunch of ghosts.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/051.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>With the power stone in hand and back in the right dimension, you’ll make your way into the Emperor’s palace, navigate a short maze, expose the Baron for wanting to steal the Emperor’s power, then once the Baron is vanquished, defeat the Emperor.</p>

<p>Yay, you’ve saved the Universe and your uncle shows up to take you back home.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/058.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Universe was surprisingly good. I’d never heard of this game and didn’t know what to expect, but the story and characters drew me in immediately. The game is beautiful, the sound effects and ambient music are fitting and really enhance the gaming experience.</p>

<p>Having watched a couple of let’s plays of the game it seems you can burn through it in a couple hours if you know what you’re doing - but to just explore the Universe and naturally experience the game takes much longer.</p>

<p>The star of this show is definitely the story, and you can feel the Star Wars influences throughout. I found myself getting caught up in the plot and looking forward to uncovering more details about the worlds I was exploring and the characters I’d meet.</p>

<p>If you love this genre and are looking to experience a great Point and Click Adventure you likely wouldn’t have, give Universe a go. You won’t be disappointed (though you may occasionally be frustrated).</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer_(video_game)">Neuromancer</a> is an adventure video game developed by Interplay Productions and published by Mediagenic (a brand name of Activision). It was released in 1988 for the Amiga, Apple II, Apple IIGS, Commodore 64, and MS-DOS. It was loosely based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer">William Gibson’s 1984 novel of the same name</a> and set within both the fictional “real world” and the extensively realized and detailed world of cyberspace.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/062.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In a grimy future, you play Case, a cyberspace cowboy who finds himself broke in Chiba City. Find yourself a laptop and the right software for it so you can hack into databases around the city to regain your access to cyberspace. Buy and upgrade brain implant chips to augment your computer skills, and sell your body parts to afford new technologies. When you get to cyberspace, you’ll take on the nasty AIs that guard the most important databases. Within all this information is the bizarre secret of this world of inbred corporations.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/038.png" alt="" />
<em>I played the Amiga version, which starts off with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT7sXsoFpZA">Paradox cracktro</a></em></p>

<p>Though I haven’t re-read the source material in well over 20 years, I have very fond memories of Neuromancer. That book kicked off a lifelong love of the cyberpunk genre, so I’ve been looking forward to playing this game since I kicked off this series.</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem to follow the events of the book at all, but definitely exists in the same universe. You start off in a bar, where you apparently spent the night that you owe the bartender money for.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/041.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You’ll also have a chance to explore the limited interface, which includes a PAX button. PAX is sort of like a basic bulletin board system, that you can read news on or access your banking information. Since you start with no money in hand, you’ll need to access your bank account and transfer all your money.</p>

<p>From the initial PAX screen you’ll learn some link codes, and also that someone named Shin has your cyberdeck.</p>

<p>Since I played a cracked version I didn’t need to refer to the <a href="https://www.c64sets.com/details_db.html?id=3227&amp;t=Neuromancer&amp;i=PAX%20verification%20code%20wheel">code wheel</a> that you’d typically need to access the PAX.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/045.png" alt="" />
<em>Yes, that’s a door below you you’ll need to go through</em></p>

<p>Navigating the game world is done using the mouse. It’s not always obvious what/where the exit to a room is, especially when there’s door at the bottom of the screen. Once you get used to keeping an eye out for these tiny slivers of doorway though it’s not too difficult to navigate the game world.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/048.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The majority of the game is spent “online”. You’ll need to first get your deck back from Shin, then find a location that has jack you can use. The most convenient location for this is the Cheap Hotel, and you’ll spend a good portion of the game here navigating various online systems, then eventually cyberspace.</p>

<p>Gaining access to a system requires a link code and a password. These are scattered throughout various messages you can read online, and are fairly straightforward to find - just make sure you write them down.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/042.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Going online costs money, and the longer you spend online - the more money you’ll gradually lose. Gaining additional money in this game can be done in one of two ways. Either you find an account online you can transfer money out of (into your account), or you sell body parts.</p>

<p>At the Body Shop, you can incrementally sell off your body parts for cash. The more parts you sell, the lower your HP (constitution?) will drop. You’ll need this later in the game when you need to start attacking databases and ICE, but you can buy your body parts back as you get more money to regain your HP.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/067.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You piece the plot of the game and your objectives together slowly by reading through the various messages on each system you gain access to. There aren’t really that many actions you can take on these systems other than reading through the contents, but many will have software (“softwarez”) libraries you can access.</p>

<p>Your deck has limited storage, so you’ll need to be mindful of what software you’re carrying and how much space you have available. As you download better versions of your software, you can delete the older versions to make room.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/052.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are a handful of characters and machines you can interact with as well using the conversation system. Typically these involve cycling through a pre-determined list of options you can ask them about, but some also have a free-form text field you can fill out.</p>

<p>This allows you to ask about specific topics, which you’ll either learn from other characters or from the messages you read on bulletin boards.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/056.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The more time you spend online, the lower your finances will fall. Thankfully there are a couple of opportunities to infiltrate banks and transfer (steal) fairly large balances of credits to your account.</p>

<p>You’ll need this money to purchase skills, upgrade your cyberdeck and buy various items. If you successfully complete these missions, remember to access your account via the PAX to download your credits so you can go shopping.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/060.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though there aren’t that many items in the game you need to interact with, there are a couple of fetch quests you’ll need to undertake. These typically just involve going back and forth between characters and asking questions, or going online and changing some information about a character to get them arrested (so they’re not blocking a doorway).</p>

<p>For this playthrough I found myself leaning on the <a href="https://www.walkthroughking.com/text/neuromancer.aspx">walkthrough</a> pretty heavily for these sequences as it wasn’t always obvious what I was supposed to do.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/068.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you upgrade your deck to one that can access cyberspace, you’ll be able to jack into the matrix and access various databases. Similar to the sites you have access to via the comlink systems, once you enter a database you’ll be able to read messages and download software.</p>

<p>The difference though is you’ll need to defeat the ICE (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_Countermeasures_Electronics">Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics</a>) first.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/080.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Fighting ICE is done with ICE-breaking software. This software is classified loosely into 3 categories: Good, Better and Best - which you’ll learn from one of the message boards.</p>

<p>The manual sort of calls out that ICE-breaking requires a lot of trial and error, and the best way to gain access to a database is to just try various combinations to see what’s effective. As a result, make sure you save before each battle - just in case.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/072.png" alt="" />
<em>Death is not permanent - but it is expensive</em></p>

<p>If you fail to break the ICE and experience brain death, you’ll respawn in the Body Shop - minus all your money. This is VERY difficult to recover from, so you’re better off to just reload a previous save and try again.</p>

<p>Assuming you haven’t sold all your body parts, you could do this to gain a little extra cash, but honestly it’s not worth it … just reload.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/088.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Your objective will ultimately be to seek out and destroy all the AI in cyberspace. There are two competing AI - Greystroke and Neuromancer - that are trying to get the other to join them to dominate cyberspace. At least that’s what I think is happening …</p>

<p>Each AI is hidden behind an ICE you’ll need to break, and the later in the game you get, the harder they are. One aspect of this game that I didn’t realize was that you’ll need to jack out of cyberspace periodically to recover your HP.</p>

<p>After each ice confrontation if you try to access another database, it looks like your “health” is full - but it actually isn’t.</p>

<p>I think it was after I’d just barely gained access to the KGB system, I moved onto the next database and found no matter what I tried, I’d die in one shot. It must have taken me a few weeks of on-and-off messing around reading other reviews and blogs (like the <a href="https://advgamer.blogspot.com/2013/07/game-32-neuromancer-oceans-one.html">Adventurer’s Guild review</a>) before I finally realized this was what you needed to do.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/092.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Defeating AIs is done with “skills”, which you buy and upgrade throughout the game. When you finally beat Neuromancer, you’ll be thrown onto a beach - which is just an illusion that it has created to trap you.</p>

<p>Using some combination of skills allows you to escape, and once you do so you’ll have officially finished the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/094.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Overall, Neuromancer is a fun game. There are a handful of distinct gameplay mechanics that aren’t that hard to learn, but do take a while to master.</p>

<p>There is occasionally background music, which isn’t bad - though I think it plays more prominently in other versions (like the C64). The Amiga version I played was mostly quiet, save for the title screen and once in a while.</p>

<p>I’m fairly certain this was one of the first games I started playing for this series, but I did so using <a href="https://apple2.gs/plus/">GSPLUS</a> and had a number of issues that made the experience cumbersome. I really want to experience as many of these games on as many emulated systems as possible, so I stubbornly just kept trying to make the GSPLUS experience happen - and it wouldn’t - so I gave up on the game for a number of years.</p>

<p>I’m really glad I circled back to it, as it really is a lot of fun. Though the similarities are not obvious, playing Neuromancer actually sort of reminded me a bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uplink_(video_game)">Uplink: Hacker Elite</a> - which I LOVE! I think it’s just the whole “cruising cyberspace and hacking” simulation portion of the game, but I found both to be equally enjoyable so figured it was worth calling out.</p>

<p>There was an attempt to reverse engineer and reimplement this game for Windows called <a href="https://github.com/HenadziMatuts/Reuromancer">Reuromancer</a>, however I’m not sure how playable this engine actually is. If you have Google Translate, the <a href="https://habr.com/post/352050/">development blog</a> (which is in Russian) is a great read.</p>

<p>I would highly recommend giving this game a chance. It can be extremely difficult and unforgiving, but if you like to read, the story is interesting and the gameplay is fairly accessible.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for something to read instead, go grab the book!</p>

  <p>Article 92 of 96 in this series.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_of_the_Phantom">Return of the Phantom</a> is a point-and-click graphic adventure game developed and published by MicroProse in 1993. It was produced by Matt Gruson and designed/written by future James Bond novelist Raymond Benson. It is based on the 1910 novel The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_(novel)">Phantom of the Opera</a> by Gaston Leroux.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_017.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game was the second graphical adventure game developed by MicroProse, following Rex Nebular and preceding Dragonsphere. It was developed using the MicroProse Adventure Development system (MADS), and made use of 256-colour graphics. A CD version featuring full voices for the characters was also released - which is the version I played.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_023.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It is the present time (1993), and many people are about to enjoy the performance of the opera “Don Juan Triumphant” at the Palais Garnier. However, that piece of art will soon become covered with the blood of innocents, as the great ceiling chandelier crushes down on the crowd.</p>

<p>The player controls Raoul Montand, a detective who’s been asked for help by his old friend Monsieur Brie, the manager of the Opera. Bringing Raoul to a crime scene, he leaves him in hope he’ll find some clues and prevent this terror from happening again. Supposedly, the disaster was caused by a being known as the Phantom of the Opera, a mysterious creature who has been haunting the opera house since 1881. The detective is about to find out what secrets lie beneath the surface, looking for clues in the present time and traveling back to 1881.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game’s intro sequence is extremely long, but it sets the stage appropriately. Though I’ve heard of the Phantom of the Opera and have seen it live at lest once in my life, the first thing that jumped out was how little I actually knew about the story.</p>

<p>My memories seem limited to just the character in the mask and cape that lives in the basement and plays the organ … so really you could have replaced the Phantom with literally anything else and this game’s story would have had the same impact.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_006.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you gain control of Raoul following the intro, you walk around the opera house and can interact with a handful of characters. These sequences are the typical dialogue trees you’ll find in other adventure games, and they help advance the plot and give you clues as to what you need to do next.</p>

<p>If you play the CD version of the game, these interactions are all fully voice acted - and the voice acting isn’t all that bad. Aside from a couple actors hamming it up a little, they definitely add to the experience and make interrogations more enjoyable.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_010.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Moving around the opera house is pretty straightforward, and exits are clear marked. If you can go in some direction, the cursor will change to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GO</code> icon with an arrow indicating which direction you can move in.</p>

<p>You also have a verb list to select from, though you’ll predominantly just be using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TALK TO</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TAKE</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_014.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game is split up into three parts. The first part has you roaming about the opera house and talking to people, learning about the history of the Phantom and getting used to the game. Eventually you’ll make your way up to the rafters, where you encounter the Phantom, get into a fight and he throws you off.</p>

<p>You’ll hit your head, and when you wake up you’ve traveled back in time to 1881 and have a completely different Phantom of the Opera mystery to solve.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_015.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This second part of the game is just an extension of the first - but in the past. I believe you’re trying to change the events of the original Phantom of the Opera to prevent a murder in your present time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_019.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game then becomes a series of fetch quests and interrogations. You’ll find out that the  Phantom is leaving notes that indicate what his demands are in a private opera box that should always be locked. Madame Giry has the only key assures you the box is locked, but somehow the Phantom is able to come and go as he pleases.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_020.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Since this game takes place in an opera house, eventually you’ll get a chance to watch the opera - but first you’ll need to find some items from your time. Madame Giry seems to know you’re from a different time, and for some reason even though you’ve got a ticket to the opera she won’t unlock the door until you fetch these items.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_016.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You’ll find coloured frames in the opera, which are for changing the colour of the lighting. These wouldn’t exist in 1881 so it’s weird you can find them - but they’re here - and you need to find at least 3 of them to proceed.</p>

<p>The leading lady - who looks exactly like the leading lady in the present - gets kidnapped and you’ll then need to go find her.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_024.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This game really holds your hand for the most part. Every time you need to do something to progress, the character interactions make it very clear what your next objective is. You’ll never feel lost, and if you do backtracking isn’t a major issue as there are only about a dozen or so screens to navigate.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_026.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You’ll be told to go find Jacques, who you’ll find has been murdered. Next to him is a skeleton key (how convenient), which you can use to unlock the secret door in box 5, which is how the Phantom has been coming and going undetected.</p>

<p>This will lead you under the opera to the catacombs, which is a giant maze.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_028.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though I hate mazes, the catacombs were fairly straightforward. There is nothing chasing you and I don’t think there’s any risk of dying, so I turned DOSBox to turbo and just wandered about (very quickly) until I found where I needed to go.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_030.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To escape the catacombs you’ll need to solve a couple of puzzles. This is the only place in the game where there are puzzles, so it was a nice change of pace and didn’t feel (too much) like busywork.</p>

<p>The first puzzle requires you to flip 4 switches in order to unlock the door. The switches hide letters of the alphabet, but what word should you try? The Phantom’s real name is Erik, so it seemed logical that that’s what the password would be.</p>

<p>If you enter the letters out of order or incorrectly, gas enters the room through a vent and kills you. Thankfully, death in this game just respawns you in the current room and you can try again.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_032.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The second puzzle is a sliding tile puzzle where you need to recreate the Phantom’s mask. Once done correctly, a trap door opens in the floor you can escape through. This is done by combining a hook and rope to make a grappling hook, which you can <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">THROW</code> to climb out.</p>

<p>You don’t actually have to interact much with your inventory but I found the system worked rather well when you did. Whenever you find a new item, you’ll automatically <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code> at it, so if it’s a letter or note, you’ll read it.</p>

<p>If you select an item in your inventory, there’s a preview image of it in one view, with a set of targeted verbs specifically for that item in a second view.</p>

<p>I really like this system as it allows for a larger verb list without cluttering the main interface. It also makes it obvious what you can do with an item.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_036.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The final showdown with the Phantom eventually takes place on top of the chandelier above the seats in the opera (the one that crashed down at the beginning of the game). There’s a bit of a scuffle, you get on top of the Phantom, rip off his mask and the chandelier comes crashing down.</p>

<p>You then wake up back in the present.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_038.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After a brief exchange, Raoul decides to double check the book in the library to see how the Phantom died, and the ending has apparently now been changed. You’re the hero of the past, though you apparently also died in the fall along with the Phantom.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_041.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I really don’t know anything noteworthy about the source material this game is based on, and didn’t find the story all that interesting. Though there’s a time travel story here, it sort of felt out of place. The entire game basically takes place in 1881, and the events of the present really aren’t necessary.</p>

<p>The game engine is quite good, and hopefully one day this will be <a href="https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Return_of_the_Phantom">officially supported in ScummVM</a> - but for now you can play this just fine in DOSBox.</p>

<p>Overall the game was fine, but I wouldn’t play it again.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I’ve been the treasurer for a couple minor hockey teams for the past five years, and though there are resources available to the parents that choose to assume this role on their kids’ teams, if you aren’t comfortable with accounting or working with spreadsheets the task can be daunting.</p>

<p>Every minor hockey association will make some resources available, and <a href="https://www.hockeycanada.ca/en-ca/hockey-programs/mha/downloads">Hockey Canada’s MHA downloads</a> currently include a minor hockey budget sheet (<a href="https://cdn.hockeycanada.ca/hockey-canada/Hockey-Programs/MHA/downloads/minor-hockey-budget-sheets-e.xls">XLS</a> and <a href="https://cdn.hockeycanada.ca/hockey-canada/Hockey-Programs/MHA/downloads/minor-hockey-budget-sheets-instructions-e.pdf">instructions</a>), but again, these really aren’t designed to do anything more than summarize the team’s finances - not track or manage them.</p>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241227113831.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Since team treasurers aren’t only accountable to the league and their team’s association, but also the parents it’s important to not only have accurate accounting of revenue and expenses, but also a way to provide transparency.</p>

<p>The money you’re handling isn’t yours - it belongs to everyone on the team. If anyone has questions as to what’s being spent on what or how much is left it shouldn’t be hard to answer.</p>

<p>To try and make this easier for future team managers and treasurers I’ve created the following <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QwTpalK0Zn5ddMlDOLlRwBrUQUW2S0BqZGddmaGb8x8/edit">Hockey Team Budget Template</a>. Feel free to download/copy/use, and if you have any feedback or questions, shoot me a message.</p>

<p>I’ll be going into some detail below as to how you can use this spreadsheet to do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Setup the Team’s Budget</li>
  <li>Manage Parent Payment Schedules</li>
  <li>Manage Revenue and Expenses</li>
  <li>Manage a Cash Float</li>
  <li>Manage Bank Transactions</li>
  <li>Account for Fundraising and Sponsorships</li>
  <li>Revise the Team’s Budget</li>
</ul>

<p>A number of <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/topic/1361471?hl=en&amp;sjid=8589949122811119968-NC">Google Sheets formulas</a> are being used across multiple sheets to provide the automation and calculations. Feel free to inspect any and modify as you like.</p>

<h2 id="setup-the-teams-budget">Setup the Team’s Budget</h2>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241227130902.png" alt="" />
<em>Figure 1: Budget</em></p>

<p>As the team treasurer, the first thing you need to work out with the team manager and head coach is how much money the season is going to cost.</p>

<p>Most of the information can be copied from previous seasons, but since prices are subject to change year over year you want to always estimate high. For example, if you paid $30K the previous year you may want to bump that to $34K this year (just in case). Always try to estimate a bit high, as he parents on the team have to pay for the season and it’s easier to refund extra money than it is to go back and ask for more 😉.</p>

<p>Each section below will match one or more of the numbered sections in <em>Figure 1</em> above.</p>

<h3 id="1-figure-out-how-much-youll-need-to-spend">(1) Figure out how much you’ll need to spend</h3>

<p>Some expenses to consider when making the budget are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Association fees</li>
  <li>Practice/game ice fees</li>
  <li>Jersey/Sock costs</li>
  <li>Referee fees</li>
  <li>Timekeeper fees</li>
  <li>Tryout fees</li>
  <li>Extra ice rental fees</li>
  <li>Tournament fees</li>
  <li>Goalie training</li>
  <li>Extra training (on-ice or off-ice) and team building</li>
  <li>Social budget (Christmas and end of season parties)</li>
  <li>Player gifts</li>
  <li>Police checks, coaches clinics, certification and training costs</li>
  <li>Trainer supplies</li>
  <li>Coaches apparel</li>
</ul>

<p>Not all of these are required, but can be used as a starting point.  Under the <em>Expenses</em> section of the <strong>Budget</strong> sheet, just add a new row for each line item you want to track, then copy the first line item as many times as you need</p>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241227132156.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you add new rows to the <em>Expenses</em> section, the total budget should be automatically updated on the last row of the sheet.</p>

<h3 id="2-figure-out-how-much-money-youll-need-to-cover-costs">(2) Figure out how much money you’ll need to cover costs</h3>

<p>Once you have your total expenses plugged in, you’ll need to make sure you collect at least that much money from the parents on the team.</p>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241227155003.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For example, if your total expenses are $96,130.00 for the season, you’ll likely want to collect at least $97,000.00.</p>

<p>Fundraising and sponsorships can never be guaranteed, but if the team agrees on a certain minimum threshold, plugging those values in will ensure you have enough money to cover costs.</p>

<p>From the example above I expect to collect $95,000.00 from the parents directly, with another $10,000.00 from sponsorship and donations, for a total budget of <strong>$105,000.000</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="3-5-updates-will-be-automatically-tracked-as-transactions-are-recorded">(3-5) Updates will be automatically tracked as transactions are recorded</h3>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241227155505.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The actual amount of money we’ve collected and spent will be summarized automatically based on how we record revenue and expenses on the <strong>Transactions</strong> sheet. We will also include details for other sources of income that may be harder to track, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Current bank balance</li>
  <li>Cash on hand</li>
  <li>Total value of outstanding (uncashed) cheques</li>
</ul>

<p>This gives us a snapshot of our current financials at all times throughout the season. If everything is adding up correctly, the <em>DIFF</em> field should be $0.</p>

<h3 id="6-expense-category-budgets-can-be-automatically-tracked-as-well">(6) Expense category budgets can be automatically tracked as well</h3>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241227155843.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We’ll need to know how much money we’ve spent in each category as the season goes on - especially if/when we go over.</p>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241227161336.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once the <em>Budget Left</em> reaches zero, you’ve met or exceeded the budget. I’ve configured <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/78413?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop">conditional formatting rules</a> so it stands out a bit more that you’ve dropped below 50% of your budget.</p>

<h2 id="manage-parent-payment-schedules">Manage Parent Payment Schedules</h2>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241227161737.png" alt="" />
<em>Figure 2: Roster</em></p>

<p>Most (if not all) the money for the season comes from the parents on the team, so it’s important to understand how much money that will be, and to keep up with payments.</p>

<p>Once you know how much each parent will need to pay, you can work backwards from when all fees should be due to figure out a schedule.</p>

<p>For our example, we’ll be collecting <strong>$6,125.00</strong> from each family. If the team was finalized in March, and we want all fees to be collected by December, a schedule such as the following might make sense:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>June 10</strong></td>
      <td><strong>CA$800.00</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>July 10</strong></td>
      <td><strong>CA$800.00</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Aug 10</strong></td>
      <td><strong>CA$1,000.00</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Sep 10</strong></td>
      <td><strong>CA$1,000.00</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Oct 10</strong></td>
      <td><strong>CA$1,000.00</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Nov 10</strong></td>
      <td><strong>CA$1,000.00</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Dec 10</strong></td>
      <td><strong>CA$525.00</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="1-5-6-7-per-player-payment-tracking">(1, 5, 6, 7) Per-player payment tracking</h3>

<p>Fill out the team roster first. Only the <em>Last Name</em> is actually used elsewhere, and the values for <em>Direct Payments</em>, <em>Other Payments (Not Reimbursed)</em>, <em>Paid</em>, and <em>Reimbursements</em> will be calculated for you based on what is recorded in the <strong>Transactions</strong> sheet.</p>

<p>The <em>Outstanding</em> value will begin from what you input as <em>Total (Per Player Rounded)</em> and subtract these transactions to help keep track of what each parent still owes.</p>

<p>To clarify terminology:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Direct Payments</em>: E-Transfers or cash from parents that are applied directly to player fees</li>
  <li><em>Other Payments (Not Reimbursed)</em>: Costs parents cover that can be subtracted from fees (ex: they paid for pizza for the team for a social event)</li>
  <li><em>Reimbursements</em>: When parents have paid <em>more</em> than the expected fees, and you want to refund them the overage amount directly</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-3-4-total-expected-revenue-from-parent-collections">(2, 3, 4) Total expected revenue from parent collections</h3>

<p>Based on what we calculated in our <strong>Budget</strong> sheet earlier, we were going to collect <strong>$95,000.00</strong> from parents, so this is imported to the <em>Total Expected (Imported)</em> field.</p>

<p>We’ve only rostered 16 players this season, so we enter that value into the <em>Total Players</em> field, which we divide the total expected value from to figured out the <em>Expected Per Player</em> total.</p>

<p>Once again, it’s easier to refund money at the end of the season than it is to ask for more money if unexpected costs occur, so round up the per-player value slightly to come up with the final <em>Total (Per Player Rounded)</em> value you’ll be collecting from parents.</p>

<p>This final value will then be multiplied by the number of players on the team to give you the final <em>Total Expected</em> value.</p>

<h2 id="manage-revenue-and-expenses">Manage Revenue and Expenses</h2>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241228091709.png" alt="" />
<em>Figure 3: Transactions</em></p>

<p>The <strong>Transactions</strong> sheet is where day to day revenue and expenses are recorded. If everything is setup properly, just keeping this sheet updated will likely be sufficient to manage your reporting for the season.</p>

<p>When you setup your <strong>Budget</strong>, each line item under <em>Expenses</em> will be available via the <em>Category</em> dropdown when you want to record a transaction now.</p>

<p>Let’s walk through some examples of recording to get a feeling for how this works.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1: Parent paid directly for team related expense</strong>
<img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241228105045.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here we can a <strong>Preseason: Tryout Related Expenses</strong> was recorded for <strong>$54.00</strong> by a member of the <strong>Boyle</strong> family. The <em>Paid By</em> dropdown is populated by the <em>Last Name</em> of each player on the <strong>Roster</strong> sheet.</p>

<p>When you specify a family under the <em>Paid By</em> column, that payment will be deducted from that player’s fees automatically. This makes it easier to keep track of how much money that family still owes towards fees if they’re contributing in other ways.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2: Parent paid their monthly dues directly</strong>
<img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241228172309.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When <strong>Parent Contributions</strong> is selected, the assumption is you’re recording a direct payment towards fees. If you check off the checkbox under the <em>Cash?</em> column, it will be recorded not only as a parent contribution, but will help keep track of your cash float.</p>

<p><strong>Example 3: Paying for an expense with a cheque</strong>
<img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241228172543.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Most teams don’t have access to E-Transfer out of a community (or team) account, and will need to pay for things with cheques. In this case, you just enter the cheque number in the <em>Chq</em> column - and once the cheque has been cashed, click off the <em>Chq. Cashed?</em> checkbox.</p>

<p>Under the <strong>Budget</strong> sheet there is a <em>Uncashed</em> section under <em>Revenue</em> where you can quickly see how much money you have outstanding in cheques that you haven’t reconciled in your bank statement yet.</p>

<h2 id="manage-a-cash-float">Manage a Cash Float</h2>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241228172904.png" alt="" />
<em>Figure 4: Cash Float</em></p>

<p>If your game officials and timekeepers are paid in cash, you’ll likely need to also manage a cash float. As money comes in from parents, some of that can be requested in cash, which when recorded in the <strong>Transactions</strong> sheet as <em>Cash?</em> will automatically be updated in the <em>Current Cash</em> field on your <strong>Cash Float</strong> sheet.</p>

<p>Periodically I’ll do a count, which I record as a line item broken down by each individual denomination I have in the float. If my <em>Total</em> matches the <em>Current Cash</em> - everything’s accounted for!</p>

<h2 id="manage-bank-transactions">Manage Bank Transactions</h2>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241229071015.png" alt="" />
<em>Figure 5: Bank Balance</em></p>

<p>I like to have all my teams’ finances in one place, so I’ll copy/paste transaction records from the online banking portal to the <strong>Bank Balance</strong> sheet.</p>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241229071405.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The last value in the <em>Balance</em> field on this sheet is what is reflected on the <strong>Budget</strong> sheet’s <em>Bank</em> value (using the formula <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=INDEX('Bank Balance'!D2:D,COUNTA('Bank Balance'!D2:D),1)</code>, for anyone that’s curious).</p>

<p>If you’re not looking to track things this granularly, the <strong>Bank Balance</strong> sheet can be ignored and you can just periodically copy the current balance from your bank statement directly into the <em>Bank</em> value of the <strong>Budget</strong> sheet.</p>

<h2 id="account-for-fundraising-and-sponsorships">Account for Fundraising and Sponsorships</h2>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241229071838.png" alt="" />
<em>Figure 6: Sponsorship &amp; Fundraising</em></p>

<p>Fundraising and sponsorships are a big way teams subsidize the cost of the season to take some of the financial burden off parents.</p>

<p>The <strong>Sponsorship &amp; Fundraising</strong> sheet doesn’t actually feed into any further automation, but is provided as a single location to keep track of these sources of income to make it easier to account for a lump sum you’ll eventually record under the <strong>Transactions</strong> sheet.</p>

<h2 id="revise-the-teams-budget">Revise the Team’s Budget</h2>

<p>When you setup the budget at the beginning of the season, you won’t know exactly how much additional money you may be able to raise or how many sponsorships you’ll get. There may also be some additional costs you didn’t anticipate, or potentially forgot all about.</p>

<p>As the season goes on, if you need to revise your budget, the most important thing to take into consideration is “can we afford this” - which should be a fairly easy question to answer.</p>

<p>As an example, let’s say we want to pay for team pictures which will cost <strong>$850.00</strong>. Using the <strong>Budget</strong> sheet, we’d do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add a line item under <em>EXPENSES</em> to add a new entry for <em>Team Pictures</em>, with a <em>Budget</em> of <strong>$850.00</strong></li>
  <li>Check our updated <em>TOTAL EXPENSES</em> to make sure it’s still below our <em>TOTAL REVENUE</em></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241229074203.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I typically <em>italicize</em> expenses that are added after the final budget has been approved so it’s easier to differentiate these items.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Being the team treasurer is a volunteer position that comes with a lot of responsibility. At the end of the season, you’re responsible for reconciling the team’s budget and paying parents back for any money that remains.</p>

<p>Hopefully using the template I’ve provided will make it a little easier to do this. If you try it out, let me know if it worked for you. I’d love to hear if this makes managing your team’s finances easier 😃.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Hockey" /><category term="budget" /><category term="treasurer" /><category term="hockey" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Download the Hockey Team Budget Template discussed in this article]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.alexbevi.com/images/hockey-budget/banner.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.alexbevi.com/images/hockey-budget/banner.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Plan 9 from Outer Space (Gremlin Ireland) - 1992</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2024/12/22/plan-9-from-outer-space/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Plan 9 from Outer Space (Gremlin Ireland) - 1992" /><published>2024-12-22T20:33:08-05:00</published><updated>2025-05-02T05:29:16-04:00</updated><id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2024/12/22/plan-9-from-outer-space</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2024/12/22/plan-9-from-outer-space/"><![CDATA[<blockquote class="prompt-tip mb-6">

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Outer_Space_(video_game)">Plan 9 from Outer Space</a> is a point and click adventure game adaptation of the film of the same name. It was developed at the Irish office of Gremlin Graphics for the Amiga and Atari ST, and was released in 1992. The game was published by Gremlin in Europe and by Konami in the United States. A DOS version was also developed, though only released in the US and Europe. Two editions of the game were made available at retail; the more common version was packaged with a VHS copy of the film, while a rarer version contained only the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/070.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The movie; Plan 9…..the critics hated it. But, the producer of the film has noticed that it’s been stolen by Bela Lugosi’s double. Find him. Track him. For God’s sake - just keep a straight head when you enter this part of the movie lot and town. Some of the most misguided people roam here! Most important…..get the film back!<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/039.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I’ve heard of the movie, and may even have seen it at some point in the past thirty years … but I don’t remember anything about it other than having a legacy of being a terrible movie. This doesn’t really set the stage for a good gaming experience, but here we go anyway.</p>

<p>Since my expectations were extremely low for this game to begin with, I figured I should play the Amiga version as my go-to emulator <a href="https://dirkwhoffmann.github.io/vAmiga/">vAmiga</a> has a handy-dandy fast-forward feature.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/038.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The <a href="https://retro-commodore.eu/files/downloads/amigamanuals-xiik.net/Games/Plan%209%20From%20Outer%20Space%20-%20Manual-DE-ENG-FR.pdf">game manual</a> doesn’t really set the stage for the game, and you’re sort of just dropped into a Movie Producer’s office who tells you you need to get the film back … and off you go.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/041.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There’s some basic copy protection to kick things off, but I opted for a cracked copy of the game to bypass this. The fine crackers at <a href="https://demozoo.org/groups/2904/">TKK</a> (only active for a brief period in ‘92 is seems) don’t seem to have included a cracktro, though it seems there are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q4rbvd2of4">examples of their work</a> if you’re curious.</p>

<p>The game’s interface is reminiscent of the MacVenture games, though in this case the vast majority of the screen is unused (just a static background). You have a small game window, and inventory list to the right of this and your verb list at the bottom right.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/043.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you explore or interact with the world and characters, a summary of these interactions fills the bottom left of the screen. Text sort of just rolls off though and there’s no scroll back so it’s easy to miss details if you’re not paying attention.</p>

<p>I found it a little hard to read the white text on the blue background, and the fact that each new interaction was indented just looked odd, but those are minor annoyances.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/047.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The graphics aren’t bad, but they’re nothing to write home about. Almost every male character uses the same model so they kind of blend together, and no one has anything interesting to say. Since I wasn’t sure what to do other than visit each screen, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EXAMINE</code> everything and move on it sort of felt like work to plod along this “adventure”.</p>

<p>You’re supposed to find a handful of movie reels spread across various cities, and typically you’ll need to complete some form of fetch quest to gain access to the place where the reel is.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/048.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are multiple locations you’ll need to explore, and these aren’t accessible until you discover them - either by examining something (like a pamphlet for the mall) or by talking to a character (the woman at the bar tells you where Bela Lugosi’s house is).</p>

<p>At each location there may be an opportunity to pick items up for later use, but inventory management is a pretty big gameplay mechanic. You only have limited “weight” you can carry - so you’ll frequently need to drop items in order to pick up new items.</p>

<p>Thankfully when you drop items some little creature picks it up and takes it back to the original location you found it. This makes it easy to backtrack and reacquire items you had to leave behind.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/053.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you find the film reels, you can take them to projection booths scattered throughout the game. Each booth has the same attendant working there that you can give a reel to and he’ll play it for you. I’m assuming these are clips from the original movie - which you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsb74pW7goU">watch on YouTube</a> if you’re curious 👀.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/061.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Talking to various characters you meet progresses the “plot”, but you need to be careful which dialogue options you pick as you can softlock the game by choosing the wrong option. For example, you need to ask this woman about the weather so that you can offer her beads and learn about a hippy camp.</p>

<p>If you hit on her first, there doesn’t appear to be a way to reset the conversation and you’re sort of stuck.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/065.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though infrequent, certain scenarios can result in a game over. I was playing this game in fast-forward for the majority of my time with the game as I had to start from scratch a couple times (due to softlocks), and because fast-forward mutes the music.</p>

<p>There’s one track that loops for the duration of the game, and there are very few sound effects. When there ARE sound effects, they tend to be extremely annoying (shrill and loud) - like the sounds in the cab or the bats in the cave.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/069.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The first half of the game all takes place in the multiple locations you travel to by cab around the studio. The second half of the game has you flying between Washington, Australia, Rio and Hong Kong. These cities you fly to have a cab outside the airport that will take you to the one location per city you can visit.</p>

<p>These travel options just sort of add padding to the various fetch quests, but that’s about it.</p>

<p>Eventually you’ll be hired by the CIA to go to Cuba to do … something. While you’re there, if you happened to bring the dictionary with you you can get the Cuban guard to give you some cigars and a poster that proves … something.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/076.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You’ll ultimately have to also go find some film for a guy in Hong Kong, which after you bring it back he gives you a talisman that you give to some monks - who then lead you to the aliens or something.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/077.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I just didn’t get it. I should probably watch the film, but this game is unlikely to add anything to that experience. Maybe if you’re a fan of the original film there’s an enjoyable experience to be had here, but I’m going to go out on a limb and say that for fans of the film - the game probably still sucks.</p>

<p>Though I would not recommend this game to anyone, it’s oddly satisfying knowing that the “worst movie ever made” also sort of translates to one of the worst gaming experiences on my list.</p>
