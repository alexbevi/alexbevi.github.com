This is notable as no database operations are being performed during this process, which points to potential issues with the library itself. The ticket author identified Mongoid::Association::Embed... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Why Use MongoDB with Ruby</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/08/18/why-use-mongodb-with-ruby/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why Use MongoDB with Ruby" /><published>2022-08-18T11:23:27-04:00</published> <updated>2022-09-06T08:43:04-04:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/08/18/why-use-mongodb-with-ruby/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/08/18/why-use-mongodb-with-ruby/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="MongoDB" /> <summary> Before discovering Ruby and Ruby on Rails I was a .NET developer. At that time I’d make ad-hoc changes to my development database, export my table/function/stored procedure/view definitions to text files and check them into source control with any code changes. Using diff functionality I’d compare the schema changes that the DBAs needed to apply to production and we’d script that out separately... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>My Blog is FINALLY PROFITABLE!</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/08/04/my-blog-is-finally-profitable/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My Blog is FINALLY PROFITABLE!" /><published>2022-08-04T08:42:24-04:00</published> <updated>2022-08-18T11:26:09-04:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/08/04/my-blog-is-finally-profitable/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/08/04/my-blog-is-finally-profitable/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="Personal" /> <summary> I signed up for Google AdSense in January of 2015 in hopes of subsidizing some of the time I spent writing with ad-based revenue. Without doing any research I quickly formed some baseless expectations of success and profitability that would see my sparsely populated, personal blog be a vehicle to financial freedom! Well humble reader … I DID IT! Ok, not really - AdSense has a payment threshold... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Hello Product Management</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/07/04/hello-product-management/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hello Product Management" /><published>2022-07-04T11:44:20-04:00</published> <updated>2022-08-18T11:26:09-04:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/07/04/hello-product-management/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/07/04/hello-product-management/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="Personal" /> <summary> Past My MongoDB Career Journey began almost 4 years ago, and I’ve enjoyed my time as a Technical Services Engineer immensely. During my tenure as part of the organization I had the opportunity to work with a number of high profile clients on some extremely challenging scenarios.

I took a run at Terranigma in 2015 and failed miserably, but I was such a huge fan of the other Quintet titles for the SNES I just couldn’t leave this unfinished. The game tells the story of the Earth’s resurrection by the hands of a boy named Ark, and its progress from the evolution of life to the present day. It was published by Enix in Japan before Ninte... </summary> </entry> </feed>
