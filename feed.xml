As a result, scripts could now be written to better understand how frequently indexes were being accessed by operations. The following script will cycle through all databases and collections (omitting admin, local and config) to produce a delimited report of index utilizat... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>What Versions of MongoDB Has This Node Run?</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/01/04/what-versions-of-mongodb-has-this-node-run/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What Versions of MongoDB Has This Node Run?" /><published>2022-01-04T15:33:44-05:00</published> <updated>2022-01-23T15:44:52-05:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/01/04/what-versions-of-mongodb-has-this-node-run/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/01/04/what-versions-of-mongodb-has-this-node-run/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="MongoDB" /> <summary> Ever wanted to know how many different versions of MongoDB the current node has run under? Assuming the node’s local database hasn’t been reset (for example via an initial sync), it will contain a startup_log collection that holds this information. On startup, each mongod instance inserts a document into the startup_log capped collection (capped at 10MB) with diagnostic information about the mo... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Troubleshooting 'MongoDB Cursor xxxxxx not found' Errors</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/12/29/troubleshooting-mongodb-cursor-xxxxxx-not-found-errors/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Troubleshooting 'MongoDB Cursor xxxxxx not found' Errors" /><published>2021-12-29T09:26:53-05:00</published> <updated>2021-12-29T14:36:44-05:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/12/29/troubleshooting-mongodb-cursor-xxxxxx-not-found-errors/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/12/29/troubleshooting-mongodb-cursor-xxxxxx-not-found-errors/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="MongoDB" /> <summary> Read operations that return multiple documents do not immediately return all values matching the query. Because a query can potentially match very large sets of documents, these operations rely upon an object called a cursor. A cursor fetches documents in batches to reduce both memory consumption and network bandwidth usage. One category of issue you may observe occasionally in your applicatio... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>MongoDB Driver Specifications</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/12/23/mongodb-driver-specifications/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="MongoDB Driver Specifications" /><published>2021-12-23T10:08:19-05:00</published> <updated>2021-12-29T13:12:35-05:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/12/23/mongodb-driver-specifications/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/12/23/mongodb-driver-specifications/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="MongoDB" /> <summary> To ensure official MongoDB Drivers are developed with consistent functionality and APIs MongoDB maintains a set of public specifications (see GitHub Repository) that driver engineers can reference while implementing functionality.
