<p>Since I want to upload these videos to YouTube for the team to review, I need a single video file. After hunting around for scripts that could do this for me, I did find a few that looked promising - such as <a href="https://github.com/scuc/GoPro-Concat-Automation">GoPro-Concat-Automation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/KonradIT/gopro-linu">gopro-linux</a>. Ultimately I wanted to be able to just do this myself with a single command, so though these tools got me most of the way there, I ended up opting for my own script instead:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

<p>This uses <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a> to concatenate the videos and copy them to a new file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">output.mp4</code>. The input list for the videos is just a bash command to generate a list of MP4 files with the full path to the file in chronological order by create date.</p>

<p>Note that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">safe</code> mode is disabled (see <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-formats.html#Options"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ffmpeg</code> options</a>) as having it enabled can result in the video creation failing for file-naming reasons. Why is this enabled by default and not disabled you might ask … <a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/5558">#5558 <em>concat protocol should run in “-safe 0” mode by default</em></a> has more info on that topic.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="video" /><category term="ffmpeg" /><category term="video" /><category term="scripting" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a HERO10 Black that I use to record video from my kids hockey games (such as this one), but since I typically move around with the camera between periods, the videos end up being “chaptered”, or multiple single videos.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Quest_III:_The_Kindred">Police Quest III: The Kindred</a> is a 1991 police procedural point-and-click adventure video game developed and published by Jim Walls and Sierra On-Line.</p>

<p>Sonny Bonds, the sergeant of Lytton police department, thought he could finally enjoy peaceful life with his wife Marie after the drug lord Jessie Bains has been put away for good. However, a series of gruesome murders perpetrated by a sinister cult known as “The Kindred” shocks the city. Marie becomes a victim of their attack and falls into a coma. It becomes Sonny’s very personal mission to track down the attackers and make them pay for their crimes.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00035.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Kindred is the third installment of the Police Quest series, its events taking place after those described in <a href="/blog/2023/02/21/police-quest-2/">Police Quest II: The Vengeance</a>. The game brings back some of the elements of the first game, such as a modified version of driving sequences and police procedures unrelated to the main plot the protagonist must go through. Computer work is particularly emphasized, requiring the player to perform tasks such as using facial composite software or figuring out murder patterns by studying a map. Like other Sierra adventures of the time, the game uses an icon-based interface for interaction with the environment.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00002.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Sonny has been promoted following the events of Police Quest II, and the game starts off with you giving a briefing to the other detectives to kick things off. There are multiple narrative threads in this title which gives it some additional depth, and you dive right into one of them as soon as the game starts. Detective Pat Morales has apparently got a complaint lodged against her for use of abusive language. Since these games are effectively police procedure simulators, you’re going to need to start off by interviewing her, then deciding what to do about said complaint and file the appropriate paperwork.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00005.png" alt="" />
<em>Picking the wrong option when filing paperwork can lead to a game over</em></p>

<p>Following the proper protocol at all times is a requirement to being successful in any Police Quest game, and luckily for you these protocols are well documented in the game’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/Police_Quest_3_-_Manual">manual</a>. There are all sorts of procedures outlined here such as how to handle felony situations, obtaining entry into private property, courtroom procedures and forceful entry into dwellings. If it’s in the manual, you’re likely going to need to do it at some point in the game so it’s not a bad idea to do the reading up front so you know what you’re dealing with.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00013.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Detective Morales will prove to be a pain in your ass throughout the game. Once you find your way downstairs on the first day and get into the squad car you’ll have to drive out to observe a failure to sign, as the driver that the detective pulled over doesn’t want to sign a citation because the officer was being rude. Yup … it’s Morales again.</p>

<p>This is another segment of the game where you’re presented with a couple options as to how you can respond, and if you pick the wrong one - it’s game over. You can send the pregnant woman to jail (which is what Detective Morales suggests), but doing so gets the department sued for $1 million and you lose your job (game over).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00041.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Being a Sierra game, expect almost every decision you make to potentially result in death. This actually makes the game a little easier to complete as exercising good game save hygiene will allow you to trial-and-error your way through most scenarios. Just save, try something, fail, reload, try the other option and move along … rinse and repeat.</p>

<p>You’ll still need to pay attention and take notes though - especially when characters mention things like case numbers, serial numbers and addresses.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00028.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There’s a computer you’ll need to use to look up case details or search for items by serial number. These pieces of information are typically mentioned during conversations with other characters and may only be referenced once. If you miss a case number when the chief is briefing you, it may not be available again and you’ll have to reload a previous save and repeat the conversation to get that piece of information (or use a walkthrough).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00032.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The computer is actually used for a number of scenarios in this game. My favourite is the scene where you bring a homeless woman back to the office because she claims she saw someone suspicious and wants to describe them to you. Instead of a police artist generating a composite image based on her description, you use the computer to generate a face based on her prompts. This is actually kind of fun and breaks up some of the monotony of police procedure.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00026.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Along with the ongoing issues with Detective Morales (who ends up being assigned as your partner on Day 2) is the subplot involving the attempted murder of your wife. Mary is stabbed in the parking lot of the mall, and your captain knows you won’t rest until the case is solved so he assigns it to you to investigate.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00039.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Investigating the case involves a lot of driving back and forth between locations and the police station. The tedious manual driving from <a href="/blog/2022/03/15/police-quest-1/">Police Quest: In Pursuit of the Death Angel</a> is back, but this time without any visual differentiation on the map (as the VGA remake of PQ1 provided). You just drive in a direction and wait for the road signs to tell you where you are - and if you’re approaching a location.</p>

<p>I did not enjoy this at all. It honestly felt like filler most of the time and was there to slow you down.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00021.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You’ll have to deal with a handful of highway patrol scenarios early on, which aren’t too difficult but require you to drive back and forth until the relevant event triggers. You’ll also have to drive back and forth to various locations and the police station to advance the story as the game progresses. There is a lot of driving in this game, and honestly I would have appreciated a “fast travel” type of option near the end …</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00046.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The locations you drive to will require investigation, and this involves more police procedure (properly collecting and handling evidence). You have a field kit in the trunk of your car that you need to open and take everything out of each time you visit a crime scene. Once you collect and bag evidence you need to return the field kit items back to the kit before you can leave the scene. This just seems like something they could have automated for you, as it artificially delays you from progressing to get a message like “You can’t get into the car until you return the field kit items to their respective slots in the kit”, or something like that.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00023.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After each scene you will either return to the police station or the hospital. If you go back to the station you’ll either be booking a perpetrator (if you arrested someone) or booking evidence. When booking evidence you’ll need to enter the case number the evidence belongs to, so make sure you’ve taken note of these. If you book a perp, you’ll need to provide the correct booking code. These are all in the manual, so you just need to make sure you pick the right one (it’s not that hard).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00037.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The subplot about your wife actually leads into a thread about multiple murders that have some kind of occult ties to them. You’ll need to keep track of the locations of these murders as there’s a final segment on the computer where you need to plot the crimes on a map of the city and draw a pattern to try to tie them together. Assuming you do this correctly you’ll draw a pentagram that will give you the location of the final crime scene.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00044.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It’ll come as no surprise that Detective Morales is tied up in all of this (there are signs throughout the game). The game also manages to link the series antagonist (Jesse Bains) to this game as well by introducing his brother near the end as being affiliated with one of the perpetrators you were trying to hunt down.</p>

<p>Though I may not love the driving in this game and find it overused, the strong story more than makes up for it. This is no surprise as the game was written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Jensen">Jane Jensen</a>, who would also go on to write <a href="/blog/2023/06/14/gabriel-knight-sins-of-the-fathers/">Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers</a>, so you know you’re in for some twists and turns and a sprinkling of the occult.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq3/scummvm-pq3-00051.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I have very fond memories of this game, and I really enjoyed going back to it - but it’s not as good as I remembered. Though there are a lot of digitized sound effects, and occasionally there is background music most of the time you just have generic background noise. The driving segments of the game are overused and just make everything feel slower as a result.</p>

<p>You do get to use the gun near the end of the game (exactly twice), but it’s not really obvious either time that this is necessary until you die and are prompted that maybe you should be “more prepared” next time.</p>

<p>Although I did find some aspects of this game entertaining, overall I was just trying to get to the end so that I could move on. If not for the strong story I would probably recommend skipping this game, but if you’ve played the first 2 entries in the series you might as experience the conclusion of Sonny Bonds’ story arc.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Crystal_(video_game)">The Dark Crystal</a> is a graphic adventure game based on Jim Henson’s 1982 fantasy film, The Dark Crystal. The game was designed by Roberta Williams and was the first Hi-Res Adventure directly released under the SierraVenture label in 1983.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dark/scummvm-hires6-apple2-00004.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Dark Crystal is closely based on Jim Henson’s film of the same name. The game is set in Thra, a world with three suns, which come together every thousand years in an event known as “The Great Conjunction”. The player controls Jen, the last survivor of the Gelfings, a race of mole-like people. He must find a dark crystal and its broken shard, and repair it to end the reign of a tyrannical lord.</p>

<p>Like other installments of the Hi-Res Adventures series, the game is entirely text-based, with non-animated graphics to illustrate the areas. Movement between areas and interaction with the game world is performed by typing commands consisting of either one or two words (a combination of a verb and an object).<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dark/scummvm-hires6-apple2-00010.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You interact with the game world via the text parser. Though the verb/noun combinations you need to identify to progress from screen to screen are pretty easy to figure out, I did find myself getting stuck on occasion when the game expected an obtuse sequence of commands. Navigation is handled by going in a direction (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EAST</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NORTH</code>) and typically when you enter a new screen (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code> at it) everything you need to know or interact with is called out pretty clearly.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dark/scummvm-hires6-apple2-00019.png" alt="" />
<em>This screen took me forever to get past</em></p>

<p>This game follows the plot of the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Crystal">The Dark Crystal</a>, so I’m guessing if you’re a fan - or have seen it recently - maybe some of these puzzles would make a bit more sense. There is one section where you need to get into the castle where the solution is to get <a href="https://darkcrystal.fandom.com/wiki/Fizzgig_(Character)">Fizzgig</a> to climb through the bars of a door to get a key that’s on the other side.</p>

<p>On the surface this type of puzzle isn’t really challenging, but up to this point in the game you have not had to interact with a multi-part prompt where you issue multiple commands with <em>no feedback</em> after entering the first. You have to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SEND FIZZGIG</code> through the bars, but when you send him it just says something like “Where?”. The response is then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SEND BARS</code> (or maybe just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BARS</code>) but if you do this wrong you have to start over and it’s not clear you were even on the right track to begin with.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dark/scummvm-hires6-apple2-00015.png" alt="" />
<em>Oh look, I’ve died again</em></p>

<p>Being such an early adventure game I’m ok with slightly obtuse puzzles, and being a Sierra game, I expect death around every corner. And you will die on most screens.</p>

<p>Though there isn’t any music throughout the game and limited sound effects, the scene drawing for a game released in 1983 really isn’t that bad. My main complaint would be that there are so few colours presented that it’s basically monochrome, but this is likely due to the Apple II only having 6 colors to choose from (Ken Williams would enhance the ADL interpreter to support dithering and expand that palette to 21 colours<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dark/scummvm-hires6-apple2-00023.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are a handful of items you can pick up and use throughout the game, but these are few and far between. It does vary the gameplay a little and add some depth to a couple puzzles. Unlike later Sierra titles you won’t find yourself overwhelmed with options, and every item you pick up is almost immediately useful, so try everything you pick up on the screen you found it!</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dark/scummvm-hires6-apple2-00025.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The movie this game is based on isn’t something I have fond memories of (or really any memory of), so playing through this game doesn’t really stir up any nostalgia. I’m sure it follows the plot pretty closely, and if you enjoyed the movie you’ll likely enjoy the game.</p>

<p>For a very early graphical adventure game it’s definitely well done and really shows off the power of the ADL engine. If you’re an interactive fiction fan you’ll likely enjoy this experience, but otherwise this one’s probably not worth playing through.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_(video_game)">Frederik Pohl’s Gateway</a> is a 1992 interactive fiction video game released by Legend Entertainment, and written by Glen Dahlgren and Mike Verdu. It is based on Frederik Pohl’s Heechee universe.</p>

<p>When humans finally managed to colonize the planet Venus, they discovered a gigantic system of artificial underground tunnels there. It is assumed that a highly advanced alien race known as Heechee has constructed those tunnels thousands of years ago. Eventually, an abandoned, yet fully functional Heechee spaceship is discovered. One of the explorers boards it, which leads humanity towards the discovery of a space station with many similar ships - all with coordinates of unknown planets already punched in. This station becomes known as the Gateway, being humanity’s only connecting point to the rest of the universe.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gate/gate_021.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Since traveling to the potentially dangerous destinations involves a great deal of risk, only some particularly courageous (or perhaps reckless) adventurers, called “prospectors”, volunteered to go on these journeys. The protagonist of the game is one of those prospectors, having won the membership alongside a small sum of money and a one-way ticket to the Gateway. Eventually, he discovers an ancient device that contain a warning against a mysterious alien species known as Assassins - and the prospector is entrusted with the task of protecting the humans from that threat.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gate/gate_012.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Gateway is a text adventure with graphics, based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heechee_Saga">Heechee (or Gateway) saga</a> series of books.  I’ve never heard of this series, but after playing this game I’m actually sort of looking forward to reading these books. Also, as this is a book series it’s not surprising that the game involves <em>A LOT</em> of reading. This is a text adventure through and through.</p>

<p>It is identical in interface and general concept to Legend’s other text-driven adventures: the player may opt for text-only input as well as selecting verbs from a list. Clicking on objects or characters within the graphical representation of the location provides a text description. Puzzles are mostly inventory-based, though there are logic-related tasks as well. The player character explores various planets during the course of the journey. In a few cases, it is possible to die in the game.</p>

<p>The game runs on the <a href="https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Legend">Legend</a> engine, which is also used by other Legend Entertainment titles such as <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/1027/spellcasting-101-sorcerers-get-all-the-girls/">Spellcasting 101</a>, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/1026/timequest/">Timequest</a> and <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/431/eric-the-unready/">Erik the Unready</a>. There was some work done on implementing the <em>Legend</em> engine in ScummVM (see <a href="https://github.com/dreammaster/scummvm/tree/legend/engines/legend">fork for details</a>) but this work has stalled. If you’ve got some C++ chops and feel like taking a stab at continuing this work, progress is just a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git clone</code> away ;)</p>

<p>The game starts off with a wall of text, a handful of static screens overlaid with more text, then you get dropped into the game world where you’re presented with a whole lot more text. I personally love text adventures, but if this is not your jam … you may not like this game.</p>

<p>It’s actually worth calling out how much of this game involves massive walls of text and expository dumps. Seeing as this is based on a book (or series of books) AND it’s a text adventure none of this should be a surprise … but it’s still a LOT of reading.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gate/gate_039.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are some characters you can interact with, which will change the view to show you a different view where that character dumps more narrative on you. As you’d expect by now, this will involve a lot more reading as … you guessed it … another wall of text is coming your way, but presented a little bit differently just to mix things up a bit.</p>

<p>The game has a MIDI soundtrack with a handful of looping samples, and though there is a “viewport” on each screen that draws the current scene, this isn’t really required. You can switch to a pure text rendition of the game via the UI if you so choose, which just gives you more space to read what the games throwing at you in great, great detail.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gate/gate_050.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though it may sound like I’m dumping on the massive amount of reading this game forces you to do, I actually quite like it. The game’s interface is extremely intuitive, and makes it fairly straightforward to determine what actions you can take on what screens, as well as what direction(s) you can move. There is a column of verbs you can click on (if you so choose), which when selected present you with what modifiers the verb expects, then another column of nouns that you can interact with.</p>

<p>If you pay attention and actually read all the text that’s being thrown your way, progressing through the game isn’t overly difficult.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gate/gate_055.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>What IS difficult (or at least frutstrating) is that there are a number of interactions in the game that require repeating the same action multiple times. For example, digging out the ore requires you to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DIG ROCK</code> twice, but this isn’t obvious based on the feedback the game gives you when you do it the first time.</p>

<p>The second frustration would be the sheer volume of puzzles that require you to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WAIT</code> on a specific screen until a certain time for an event to be triggered. Typically the game will tell you where you need to be and at what time, but occasionally you’ll have to just keep typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WAIT</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WAIT UNTIL HH:MM</code> to force a longer wait until a fixed time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gate/gate_061.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I personally really dislike these types of puzzles in adventure games, as it feels like artificial padding. If you want me to hide in a box and wait for someone to come in and do something I’ll observe, make the act of hiding in the box be the event trigger …</p>

<p>The story is split into 3 parts, with each being self contained but building on the events of the last part. For part 1 you’re introduced to the world, including the lore and background on the Gateway and the Heechee. You learn about exploring space as a prospector and how the game expects you to proceed. You’ll eventually join the Orion program and discover that humanity is in peril and only you can save them. You visit planets, activate these pillar things on each and that does …. something.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gate/gate_043.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you activate four of these monuments you find out you’ve alerted the big baddy who’s going to wipe out all of humanity - unless you stop them. This takes place inside a simulation or an AI or something, and involves solving more puzzles in some weird settings (like a random cocktail party, then hell).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gate/gate_066.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though you’re typically not in any danger for most of the game, you can die in certain situations. Thankfully it’s really easy to save and restore here (it’s just another command) so it’s worth saving early and ofter. I found myself saving, then mashing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WAIT</code> on many screens just to see if it would trigger something to change. If it didn’t, I’d just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RESTORE</code> my last save and try something different.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gate/gate_071.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This game uses a similar engine to <a href="/blog/2023/05/23/companions-of-xanth/">Companions of Xanth</a>, but I’m guessing a much earlier version. Overall I actually really enjoyed playing through this title, and found it was reminiscent of some of my favourite menu-driven adventure games such as <a href="/blog/2021/08/16/shadowgate/">Shadowgate</a> or <a href="/blog/2021/08/15/princess-tomato-in-the-salad-kingdom/">Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom</a>.</p>

<p>The story is engaging, and though there’s a lot of exposition, you find yourself carefully reading everything that everyone says as the world that is being described is really interesting and immersive. I found myself having to use a walkthrough many times as I likely missed details I shouldn’t have glossed over, or I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time and had some <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WAIT</code>ing to do …</p>

<p>Gateway isn’t a game you’re going to play for the graphics, the sound effects or the music. If this was released by Sierra in 1982 you wouldn’t have been disappointed, and for adventure game fans that love story above all else, there’s plenty to enjoy here still.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Kyrandia">The Legend of Kyrandia: Fables and Fiends</a> (or The Legend of Kyrandia: Book One) is a 2D point-and-click adventure game, and the first game in the Fables &amp; Fiends series. It was developed by Westwood Studios and published by Virgin Games in August 1992.</p>

<p>Players take on the role of a young prince who must end the tyrannical chaos of an evil court jester in his kingdom. The game makes use of a simple interface system that allows the player to interact with objects and people, while solving various puzzles using a variety of items and special abilities.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kyra1/scummvm-kyra1-cd-1-00001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You start off with a decent cinematic sequence that introduces Kallak - a mystic - who’s also your grandfather. Your parents were murdered by the evil jester Malcolm, who shows up out of nowhere and turns Kallak to stone. He leaves a note behind that you’re supposed to show to Zanthia so she can tell you what to do next.</p>

<p>Though the characters and plot are introduced quickly and simply, it’s a bit generic here and all you know is “I’ve got item A that needs to be taken to location A” … so off we go.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kyra1/scummvm-kyra1-cd-1-00002.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Interacting with the game world is pretty straightforward and involves just clicking on everything. The cursor only changes shape to indicate a direction you can move, but if you can interact with something (or pick it up) you won’t know until you click on it. When you can pick something up, the cursor takes the shape of the thing you’ve grabbed, and you can either drop it or put it in one of the 10 inventory slots you have available.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kyra1/scummvm-kyra1-cd-1-00009.png" alt="" />
<em>The birthstone puzzle is random every time you play, so just save every time you get one right and load when you don’t</em></p>

<p>The game will remember where you drop items, so though you have limited inventory slots, it’s really not a big deal. Some of the puzzles involve trial and error so you may want to collect a bunch of duplicates of items before attempting the puzzle. For example, the birthstone puzzle involves placing gems in a specific sequence (randomized on each playthrough). If you put the wrong stone on the alter, it vanishes and if you need the same stone later, you’ll have to go find it in the forest again.</p>

<p>I picked up a bunch of duplicates before attempting this puzzle and just dropped them on the ground in front of the alter. Then as I muddled may way through the puzzle I had more than enough gems to eventually solve the sequence required to move on with the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kyra1/scummvm-kyra1-cd-1-00010.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You’ll meet Malcolm pretty early in the game, but he just sort of taunts you and leaves you alone. He’ll show up again later to delay your progress but hiding a key item you’ll then need to find, but other than that he doesn’t really pose any sort of threat to you.</p>

<p>I played through the DOS CD version of the game, so I got to “enjoy” the voice acting as a result. You can tell they swung for the fences a bit here - especially the actor that played Malcolm. It’s not the worst voice acting for this era of game … but it’s pretty bad.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kyra1/scummvm-kyra1-cd-1-00006.png" alt="" />
<em>When Brandon tells you the snake poisoned him you should probably do something about it</em></p>

<p>The puzzles in this game really aren’t that difficult, and are typically just a series of fetch quests. There are a couple of ways that you can die, so it’s important to be diligent with your save-game hygiene. I got caught off guard a couple times and found myself replaying large sections of the game because I bumbled into a death scenario accidentally.</p>

<p>Your main goal in this game is to amass magical power so that you can fight Malcolm and free Kallak from the stone spell that was cast on him. This is done by getting an amulet that displays in the lower-right portion of the screen as 4 stones. Each time you learn a spell one of these stones lights up, and if you click it you’ll cast that spell.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kyra1/scummvm-kyra1-cd-1-00017.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Seeing as you only have 4 spell slots I would have expected magic to play a larger part in the game, but it really doesn’t. Heck, the spell that turns you into a pegasus is only used once and the final spell you learn from the ghost of your mother is used twice.</p>

<p>Once you use these spells, all magic becomes unavailable, but these charge back up after a little while and you can use them again.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kyra1/scummvm-kyra1-cd-1-00011.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For me, the biggest challenge of this game was navigating the maze that is the caves. You find yourself trapped after stepping on a pressure plate, and you’ll need to go collect bricks to weigh down a counterweight to reopen the gate. This involves navigating a maze, but any time you go to a dark room you’ll be killed.</p>

<p>You find fireberries that you can pick up and drop to illuminate a room, but you can only move up to 3 rooms before the berries become ineffective. If you drop a berry it’ll keep that room lit thereafter, but you’ll need to make sure that once you run out of berries, the next room you go to contains a bush with more berries.</p>

<p><img src="https://wiki.scummvm.org/images/6/64/Kyramap2.png" alt="" />
<em>A map of the caves is super helpful</em></p>

<p>The ScummVM wiki helpfully shares a map of the caves, so I ended up using that to get through this section a bit quicker. Typically this type of spelunking involves getting 3 berries, going to one room, dropping a berry, saving, then going to the next room - rinse - repeat. If you run out of berries and die in the next room, reload and pick a different room.</p>

<p>It’s tedious, but not overly challenging.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kyra1/scummvm-kyra1-cd-1-00015.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though you’re trying to get magic spells, the second half of the game also involves mixing potions that act as single-use spells. This was just another excuse to pad the game out with backtracking fetch-quests, as mixing the potions wrong involved depleting consumable items you’d then need to go back and re-fetch to try again in a different combination.</p>

<p>I really didn’t enjoy this section as it felt forced and wasn’t really introduced meaningfully.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kyra1/scummvm-kyra1-cd-1-00022.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You’ll eventually make your way to Kyrandia castle where Malcolm is, gain the final spell, navigate another maze, solve a couple more puzzles and face off with Malcolm. The final fight is a bit anticlimactic and just involves trial and error until you land on the right spell (make yourself invisible) and stand in the right place (in front of the mirror on the right).</p>

<p>Malcolm casts the spell to turn you to stone, it bounces off the mirror and turns him to stone instead. This frees Kallak from his and you become the new king of Kyrandia. Mission accomplished!</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kyra1/scummvm-kyra1-cd-1-00024.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The first installment in the Legend of Kyrandia series is nothing groundbreaking. Some of the writing is clever and I really like the main villain, though he doesn’t really do anything during the game other than show up a couple times to delay your progress.</p>

<p>If you’re going to play this game I’d recommend ScummVM with <a href="https://docs.scummvm.org/en/v2.6.1/advanced_topics/understand_audio.html#what-is-mt-32">MT-32 device emulation</a> for the music and sound. The music is <em>much better</em> in MT-32 mode, as are a lot of the adventure games from this era that supported this audio device.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to the sequels to this game, though the initial entry didn’t really make much of an impression.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Seed_(video_game)">Dark Seed</a> is a psychological horror point-and-click adventure game developed and published by Cyberdreams in 1992. It exhibits a normal world and a dark world counterpart, which is based on artwork by H. R. Giger. It was one of the first point-and-click adventure games to use high-resolution (640 × 350 pixels) graphics, to Giger’s demand.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/start_001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You play Mike Dawson, an ad company manager who, in pursuit of his goal in life to become a writer, purchases a solitary mansion in a small town called Woodland Hills. Although the low cost and hush-hush transactions when purchasing the house do raise your suspicion, the solitary environment and sheer beauty of the house crush common sense and you decide to buy the house. That’s when the trouble begins. Upon reaching the house, you suddenly feel tired. You find a bed and fall asleep…</p>

<p>… and wake up from a terrible dream, only to find out that your life has just become a worse nightmare: an unknown source has implanted a seed of darkness in your mind, and you only have three days to find a way to stop it.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<em>Game error number 66 you say … I’m sure everything’s still fine though … right?</em></p>

<p>I have a feeling this is an issue with the environment I was playing the game in, but I could not get past the first section of the game no matter what I tried. I would go through the initial motions to take a shower and take pills, go downstairs and answer the door, go outside and pick up the package … and the game would just restart! I honestly thought this was on purpose the first few times, but when I’d go to save or load the game it showed an error message … which seemed odd.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/command_000.png" alt="" />
<em>It’s been a hot minute since I’ve busted out the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/attrib"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ATTRIB</code></a> command</em></p>

<p>After cruising the internet I stumbled on a <a href="https://www.gameboomers.com/forum/ubbthreads.php/topics/136455/dos-game-dark-seed">discussion that seemed to cover the exact issue</a> I was experiencing, and the solution was to change the properties of the installed files.</p>

<p>On the off chance anyone reads this review that has this problem, the solution is to go to the install directory for Darkseed in DOSBox and run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ATTRIB -R *.*</code> to remove the readonly attribute on the game’s files.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/start_002.png" alt="" />
<em>What a pretty doll someone sent me for some reason that isn’t suspicious at all</em></p>

<p>Once I could successfully pick up the package on Day 1, the game allowed me to progress an there were no further issues.</p>

<p>Dark Seed takes place over the course of 3 days, with each day of game time taking roughly an hour of actual time. Time and timing is a huge factor in this game - certain events only happen at certain times, and if you take too much or too little time you can miss things. This is actually extremely frustrating as there’s typically no indication that a certain event will be triggered at a specific time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/tos_009.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If it gets too late in the day Mike will decide it’s time for bed and go to sleep. Assuming you’ve done nothing about the headaches or you pass the 3 day mark, the alien embryo implanted in your brain will hatch and it’s game over.</p>

<p>Seeing as time is such a huge element of this game, it’s a bit surprising that you don’t have a default mechanism at your disposal to tell time right from the beginning. You can find a watch in the attic (hidden under a trunk you need to push out of the way), or you can backtrack to your living room and look at the grandfather clock, but I would have expected it to be a lot more prominently displayed (maybe in the main game UI).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/tos_010.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/DARK_SEED_QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD">Quick Reference Card</a> tells you you can press the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code> key at any point to advance time to the top of the next hour in case you find yourself “with lots of time to kill”. They allude to the fact you need to wait around for certain events to trigger, but not what they may be, when they’ll occur or on what screens.</p>

<p>My gameplay process (once I better understood the time mechanic) was to save the game, go to various screens and mash the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code> key a bunch of times to see if anything triggered before Mike said he was tired and it was time for bed. This would at least give me some clue as to what might be needed on that screen (and at what time). This isn’t particularly fun - but it at least helped me progress.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/tos_000.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The interface is that of a typical point-and-click game from this time period. You have your inventory at the top of the screen and a handful of interaction options you can cycle through by right-clicking the mouse. Mike can be moved around the screen, and if you mouse over a hot-spot you can cycle through various action icons like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TAKE</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">USE</code>, etc.</p>

<p>The game world is pretty small and is split into two main areas: reality, and the dark world. Reality is Mike’s house, the town and a cemetary. These make up about a dozen areas you can explore, which have a mirror version in the dark world. This is actually a pretty cool dynamic, as part of the puzzle solving process is changing things in reality to see how it changes the dark world.</p>

<p>For example, when you get thrown in jail you can stash some items under the pillow. When you find yourself in jail in the dark world, those items will be waiting for you.</p>

<p>Getting to the dark world is done by walking through the mirror in your living room. You need to fix the mirror first (it’s missing a chunk in the bottom corner that gets sent to you in the mail), but this happens pretty early in the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/tos_007.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Navigating the dark world is pretty straightforward once you realize it’s a mirror image of reality. There are some aliens you’ll need to interact with and a couple puzzles to solve, but you actually don’t have a whole lot to do here - which is a shame because it looks awesome.</p>

<p>Since the artwork was inspired by H. R. Giger’s work, everything has this Aliens vibe. The creature designs definitely have that unique Giger style, and every cutscene plays out so much better as a result.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it’s not obvious what you need to do most of the time, and it’s VERY easy to miss things and find yourself in an unwinnable situation. For example, if you enter the dark world too late in the day Mike might fall asleep on a random screen if he decides it’s bed time - and this results in you dying. The game doesn’t actually tell you that’s what’s happening though - you just randomly fall over and the game restarts.</p>

<p>Save early, save often - maintain MANY save files!</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/tos_018.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Most of the clues you get are from examining items you find along the way. They do help point you in the right direction most of the time, but this game can be pretty challenging where there are gaps in the narrative.</p>

<p>As you proceed you’ll find yourself listening to the same short music samples looping on each screen. These are very repetitive and very annoying. You spend a lot of time roaming around your house, and the house “theme” is the worst of them all. If the goal was to create a sense of “you’re going insane” - mission accomplished!</p>

<p>It’s a bit of a slog to get through this game, but thankfully it’s easy to find walkthroughs … and the game itself is pretty short.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/tos_017.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Apparently your objective was to smash the mirror in your house to sever the connection between reality and the dark world. Building the magic hammer you need to smash the mirror is the only item combination puzzle in the game, so it’s not intuitive - and also it’s not really obvious this is what you’re supposed to be doing.</p>

<p>Regardless, you make this hammer, go back to reality to start the car in the garage, go back to the dark world to launch some spaceship (that is the mirror version of the car I think), go back to reality to smash the mirror and the game is over.</p>

<p>I struggled a lot with the endgame as nothing you had to do made any sense. I tried … failed … consulted the walkthrough … and was done with it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/tos_020.png" alt="" />
<em>You sell your house - game over</em></p>

<p>This game had a lot of promise. I really liked the premise, and the story is actually pretty interesting but you find yourself rushing through everything because of the rigid time mechanic.</p>

<p>It’s also not a very hard game, though certain puzzles aren’t intuitive which can be frustrating.</p>

<p>Though I wouldn’t recommend this game, I can’t say I had a bad time playing it. I’m actually looking forward to the sequel (<a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/4257/dark-seed-ii/">Dark Seed II</a>) to see how they build on the initial story and if they can iron out some of the rough edges.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Cauldron_(video_game)">The Black Cauldron</a> is an adventure game designed by Al Lowe of Sierra On-Line and published in 1986. The game is based on the Disney film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Cauldron_(film)">The Black Cauldron</a>, which was itself based on the Chronicles of Prydain novel of the same name by Lloyd Alexander. It was made shortly after the first King’s Quest game, so it resembles that game in many ways. Along with The Dark Crystal it remains one of only a few adventure games by Sierra to be based on films.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/bc/scummvm-bc-1-00015.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though this game was released in 1986, I played the v2 release from 1988 which I believe is “updated” somewhat because it felt like I was playing King’s Quest III but using Roger Wilco from Space Quest I. If you look at the screenshots from the <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/194/the-black-cauldron/screenshots/apple2gs/">Apple IIgs release</a> it looks more like KQ1.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/bc/iScreen Shoter - 20231114072843099.png" alt="" />
<em>I tried watching the movie a bit while playing the game, but lost interest pretty quickly</em></p>

<p>Honestly, the movie this game was based on isn’t something I have fond memories of as a child. I seem to remember watching it and not really liking it as it felt like a lamer version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sword_in_the_Stone_(1963_film)">The Sword in the Stone</a> (which I loved). I even had the movie playing in the background for a bit to see if I could get back into it … but I couldn’t.</p>

<p>As a result, I had to rely on the story as the game presented it and couldn’t fill in the gaps from memory. This proved to be challenging as there’s really not much of an introduction - after the title screen you’re just dropped into the first scene in front of Dallben’s cottage. When you go inside he tells you to go feed your pig … because she’s special for some reason.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/bc/scummvm-bc-1-00001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To get into the cottage you have to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DO</code> the door once you walk up to it. This threw me off at first, as the game doesn’t have a text parser and you only have access to 3 verbs at any point: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">USE</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DO</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code> - with these all being mapped to function keys.</p>

<p>Though it felt “wrong” at first, this interface was actually extremely innovative and forward thinking as the same concept would ultimately dominate the “point and click” variations of these games once using the mouse became the primary driver for interaction.</p>

<p>If you replace the function keys with a command bar of actions (like in Sierra SCI games), or the context popup menus from LucasFilm games - this game did it first.</p>

<p>This is an AGI game, so you primary navigate using the directional arrows on your keyboard - but you can also use the mouse. I found this incredibly useful for navigating tight diagonal sections such as climbing the rope to the Horned King’s castle. If you try and do this with incremental <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UP</code>+<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LEFT</code> presses, you’re going to fall - and you’re going to die.</p>

<p>Since this is a Sierra game, death is around most corners. You also occasionally get thirsty or hungry, and if you don’t deal with that quickly - you die. Honestly this wasn’t too big of a challenge once you find the “food wallet” as it contains unlimited food, and the water flask can be filled to contain three or four drinks worth of water.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/bc/scummvm-bc-1-00003.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Progressing through the game just involves mashing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DO</code> keys on most screens to identify what you’re supposed to interact with, then interacting with it. Since the same hotkey is used for opening/closing things, talking to characters, and picking up items you get used to the limited actions the game provides pretty quickly.</p>

<p>Some locations (like the cupboard in cottage) contain multiple items. As you pick items up, if there’s something “behind” it, the game will show you this right away so you’re unlikely to miss anything. This is really helpful, though I did miss the lute the first time around because when you <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DO</code> the hole in the tree the first time it just tells you there’s a lute there - the second <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DO</code> actually picks it up.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/bc/scummvm-bc-1-00012.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game world is a lot smaller than most AGI games of this era, so it doesn’t take long to explore it all. Eventually you make it to the castle where there’s a princess you’re supposed to rescue - though I don’t remember her being introduced at any point before you find her.</p>

<p>Once you find the room in the basement where she can squeeze through a hold and escape, she’s gone until the final credit sequence. I have a feeling based on the bit of the move I was able to watch that she’s a lot more important to the plot, but this isn’t really communicated by the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/bc/scummvm-bc-1-00014.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You’ll find a sword in the castle that you can pick up and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">USE</code> on the castle guard. If you don’t, he’ll catch you and it’s game over (except the first time you enter the castle and he throws you in the basement instead). Of all the items you can pick up and use, the sword is one of the only ones that you can “see” being used as the action of swinging it is animated. The other is the fairy dust, which if you sprinkle it you’ll be able to fly around for a few seconds, which is useful later in the game as it lets you skip jumping on stones to cross the swamp.</p>

<p>Though you can use the other items they’ll just give you a description on screen as to what their effect (or lack thereof) was.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/bc/scummvm-bc-1-00017.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Eventually you get to the 3 witches (I think that’s what they are) who you trade your sword to for the black cauldron, which is promptly stolen by a dragon and flown back to the Horned King’s castle. You then need to backtrack all the way to the castle, find the Horned King in the basement and show him the mirror - which makes him stumble backwards and fall into the cauldron.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/bc/scummvm-bc-1-00020.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Playing through this game is predominantly silent. There is a title screen with PC speaker music, and some sound effects throughout (beeps and boops mostly) but that’s about it.</p>

<p>Apparently this game actually has multiple endings and there’re some branching paths. The annoying monster you meet right at the beginning (Gurgi) can show up and jump in the cauldron at the end instead of the Horned King if you follow a certain path. This is apparently how the movie plays out (I had to look this up), which is kind of cool.</p>

<p>Overall this game was just “Ok”. I thought replacing the text parser with a couple of function keys was an interesting choice and streamlined the interaction with the game world. This is definitely a very approachable adventure game, and though I didn’t fully watch the movie before playing it - it does seem to follow the plot. If you’re a fan of the movie I have a feeling you’d enjoy playing this game.</p>

<p>I didn’t realize the movie this was based on was the first Disney animated film to (1) receive a PG rating, and (2) to include computer generated imagery. Considering this was released in 1985, the latter point is pretty impressive :)</p>

<p>If you’re a fan of the movie, you might enjoy playing this game but as an adventure game fan I wouldn’t recommend it. For anyone looking for a Sierra AGI game from this era, there are better options.</p>

The MongoDB Atlas documentation outlines several methods to <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/troubleshoot-connection/">troubleshoot connection issues</a>, including how to handle <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/troubleshoot-connection/#connection-refused-using-srv-connection-string">“Connection Refused using SRV Connection String”</a> scenarios, but why does this happen in the first place?</p>

<h2 id="about-dns-seedlists">About DNS seedlists</h2>

<p>To coincide with the release of MongoDB 3.6, all drivers (at the time) implemented the <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/initial-dns-seedlist-discovery/initial-dns-seedlist-discovery.rst">initial DNS seedlist discovery</a> specification to ensure connections could be established using the new <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#std-label-connections-dns-seedlist"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SRV</code> connection string format</a>, as well as the legacy <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#standard-connection-string-format">standard connection string format</a>.</p>

<p>This functionality was introduced to abstract away the complexity of MongoDB’s connection strings (for MongoDB Atlas users at least) by moving the component parts of a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/">connection string</a> to two DNS records: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV_record">service record (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SRV</code>)</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TXT_record">text record (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TXT</code>)</a>.</p>

<p>Users now only need to supply a connection string such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongodb+srv://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@cluster0.abcde.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase</code>, and regardless as to whether the underlying cluster was a replica set or sharded, the connection string would remain the same. Furthermore, use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongodb+srv://</code> enables drivers to detect additions/removals of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongos</code> in a sharded cluster<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Tools such as <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/nslookup"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nslookup</code></a> or <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/dig"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dig</code></a> can be used to view the contents of these DNS records, such as in the following example:</p>

<h2 id="what-can-go-wrong">What can go wrong?</h2>

<p>MongoDB’s drivers require the information from <em>both</em> DNS queries in order to successfully establish, authenticate and authorize a connection to a MongoDB Atlas cluster. If either of these queries fail, only part of the connection string details will be present, and if the driver doesn’t error out right away, the subsequent connection attempt may be missing necessary information.</p>

<p>For example, per the <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/auth/auth.rst#implementation">Authentication specification</a> regarding connection string options, when it comes to selecting the authentication source:</p>
<ol>
  <li>if <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#mongodb-urioption-urioption.authSource"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">authSource</code></a> is specified, it is used.</li>
  <li>otherwise, if database is specified (in the connection string), it is used.</li>
  <li>otherwise, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">admin</code> database is used.</li>
</ol>

<p>Given this order of operations, if the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SRV</code> record resolves, but the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TXT</code> record <em>doesn’t</em>, assuming the driver doesn’t error out first the database provided in the connection string will be used for authentication. Using our original example of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongodb+srv://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@cluster0.abcde.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase</code>, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">myFirstDatabase</code> database will be used to authenticate …. which will result in an authentication failure such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MongoServerError: Authentication failed</code>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, though MongoDB’s drivers support automatic retryability of <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/retryable-reads/">reads</a> and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/retryable-writes/">writes</a>, these DNS query failures aren’t retryable. There is currently a project proposed (<a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DRIVERS-2757">DRIVERS-2757</a>) to improve this in the future, but for now these errors bubble up to the application immediately.</p>

<h2 id="can-these-issues-be-prevented">Can these issues be prevented?</h2>

<p>The best way to avoid these issues entirely is to just use the legacy <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#standard-connection-string-format">standard connection string format</a>. If you’re connecting to a replica set, the <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-discovery-and-monitoring.rst">server discovery and monitoring</a> functionality of each driver will ensure topology changes are automatically discovered.</p>

<p>Note that this will prevent new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongos</code>’ from being discovered in a sharded cluster, however if you don’t anticipate these to change frequently this will likely be a non-issue as well.</p>

<h2 id="are-other-drivers-affected">Are other drivers affected?</h2>

<p>Failure to resolve DNS records can affect all MongoDB drivers, however it’s highly unlikely you’ll actually encounter this in a production setting. As there still remains a non-zero chance this issue will manifest, here are some examples of failures you may see from other drivers:</p>

  <p>Building with Go 1.11+ and using connection strings with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongodb+srv</code> scheme is unfortunately incompatible with some DNS servers in the wild due to the change introduced in https://github.com/golang/go/issues/10622. You may receive an error with the message “cannot unmarshal DNS message” while running an operation when using DNS servers that non-compliantly compress SRV records. Old versions of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kube-dns</code> and the native DNS resolver (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">systemd-resolver</code>) on Ubuntu 18.04 are known to be non-compliant in this manner. We suggest using a different DNS server (8.8.8.8 is the common default), and, if that’s not possible, avoiding the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongodb+srv</code> scheme.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="dns-is-hard-">DNS is hard …</h2>

<p>It sure can be, as intermittent/transient network events can also impact MongoDB drivers’ ability to resolve DNS queries. The drivers (typically) rely on low-level OS APIs (such as <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/getaddrinfo"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getaddrinfo</code></a>) for network address and service translation. As such you may occasionally get errors such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MongooseServerSelectionError: getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN cluster0-shard-00-01.abcde.mongodb.net</code> even when using the legacy (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongodb://</code>) URI scheme.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_in_Time_(video_game)">Lost in Time</a> is a computer adventure game developed and published by Coktel Vision in 1993. It was promoted as being “The first Interactive Adventure Film using Full Motion Video Technology” and contained four graphical elements: full motion video, hand painted and digitized backgrounds and 3D decor.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lit/scummvm-lit-us-00001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This game had a lot of promise based on the description, and when I started reading up on the story I got a little excited. Unfortunately, that didn’t last and as soon as you start playing this game you realize it’s just not that good.</p>

<p>Lost in Time doesn’t really introduce the story at all as the game sort of just “starts” in the hold of a ship. You’ll piece together bits of backstory as you go and discover there’s some undertones of time travel and you’re at the center of it all somehow but it didn’t really flow very well.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lit/scummvm-lit-us-00007.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Eventually you’ll open a door and find Melkior, who is a member of the time police or something to that effect. You’ll need to free him, but this will involve solving a bunch of item combination puzzles, which first involves finding the items.</p>

<p>This game is one giant fetch quest, but it manages to execute these in the most obtuse and least fun ways possible. Each static screen only has a handful of hot-spots you can interact with so it’s not too difficult to identify <em>what</em> you need to click on, but it’s not obvious that you’ll need to revisit some of these repeatedly.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lit/scummvm-lit-us-00008.png" alt="" />
<em>You’ll see this screen a lot throughout the game</em></p>

<p>There were a couple releases of this game - text only and fully voice acted. I opted for the latter, which in hindsight was a mistake. The voice acting in this game is atrocious. The lip synching is typically off (which is fine for 1993), but the actors are really shooting for the moon with their performances. It doesn’t help that every time Doralice (the protagonist) has anything you say you get this same visual representation of half her face moving up and down.</p>

<p>It was a missed opportunity when they released this game on CD that they did’t include the subtitles that were present in the disk version. The voice acting is slow and drawn out - and you can’t skip any of it. I’m fairly certain you couldn’t make the text advance any faster in the disk version but it felt less irritating none the less.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lit/scummvm-lit-us-00005.png" alt="" />
<em>What are jokers and why do I have three of them?</em></p>

<p>The game has (what I believe to be) a hint system called “Jokers”. The game doesn’t give you any indication what these are, why they’re limited, or why they’re only present in select places. Even going back and reading through the <a href="https://www.starehry.eu/download/adventure/docs/Lostintime-Manual.pdf">game’s manual</a> only tells you:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“There are a few “jokers” available in various places throughout the game that will give you some hints if you are stuck. You are only allowed to use three”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’re curious to play this game give the manual a read as it does introduce the game’s concepts and characters much better than the game itself does.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lit/scummvm-lit-us-00013.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To play this game is to just click every labelled hotspot (multiple times), then try and combine everything with everything. For the limited number of interactive areas per screen there are A LOT of items you’ll need to collect, combine and try on each screen. Since this is an adventure game this mechanic isn’t surprising, but the types of item combinations you need to perform are unintuitive in many cases.</p>

<p>You’ll also need to be aware of items that contain other items that you’ll need to “remove” from their containers to use them properly. You may also find yourself combining items “in the wrong order” which doesn’t give you any indication that you’re doing something wrong …</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lit/scummvm-lit-us-00022.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Since there’s going to be a lot of backtracking it is convenient that the game gives you a fast-travel map. There are only three “levels” in this game, so there’s really not much you need to explore, but the sheer amount of backtracking to these static screens just to attempt to use every new item with every existing item and every possible hotspot draws this out unnecessarily.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lit/scummvm-lit-us-00028.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The reviews of this game (at time of release) were generally positive for how the live-action video was incorporated. Honestly it’s pretty hard to watch and feels out of place and not overly well done. Seeing as this game came out the same years as “The 7th Guest” and “Myst” you can’t even point to it and say “well, it was good for 1993”.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it’s not just the video and voice acting that sucks in this game. The sound effects feel out of place throughout the game and really give you the sense that they’re just stock effects the developers threw together. Overall it’s just not a good game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lit/scummvm-lit-us-00034.png" alt="" />
<em>OMG THE GAME ENDS WITH HIM LOOKING AT THE CAMERA AND FUCKING WINKING!!!</em></p>

<p>Lost in Time is not fun. So far Coktel Vision games just aren’t very good … and there are still many more to go in this series. It’s so frustrating that you need to “re-look” at many areas in this game <em>after</em> you pick items up as they may contain another item that wasn’t visible when you first inspected the area. For example, there’s a drawer you open at one point to pick up a diary … then if you click the drawer again you open it <em>more</em> to find something else. WHY NOT JUST SHOW 2 ITEMS IN THE DRAWER THE FIRST TIME???</p>

<p>You can also miss items easily, and will lose the game if you don’t remember to “remove” the flower from the bag on the last screen before catching the snake and throwing the bag in the fire. Why you ask? Because you need to throw the flower at the main antagonist to make him sneeze and fall to his death off a log bridge you somehow find yourself on for the final conflict.</p>

<p>I really wanted to like this game, but I really didn’t. I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventureland_(video_game)">Adventureland</a> is a text adventure video game for microcomputers released by Scott Adams in 1978. The game has no plot but simply involves searching for thirteen lost artifacts in a fantasy setting. Its success led Adams to form Adventure International which went on to publish thirteen similar games in the Adventure series, each in different settings.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/advland/001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I opted to play the Commodore 64 release of this game as it was a slight upgrade to the original text adventure format. This also gave me a chance to try out a new emulator - <a href="https://dirkwhoffmann.github.io/virtualc64/">VirtualC64</a>. If you’re an OSX user I would highly recommend this as <a href="https://www.dirkwhoffmann.de/">Dirk Hoffmann</a> has created an extremely intuitive user experience here (as he did with <a href="https://dirkwhoffmann.github.io/vAmiga/">vAmiga</a>).</p>

<p>The game’s “UI” is split into three parts. You have the visualization of the room on the top half and the text parser on the bottom half, but if you press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ENTER</code> the visualization is replaced with a description of the scene.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/advland/011.png" alt="" />
<em>Press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ENTER</code> for a summary of the screen including exits and items</em></p>

<p>Once you realize that this third view exists the game gets a lot easier as all exits and items you can collect become obvious. The goal of the game is to just pick up various “treasures”, which you’ll have to drop into a stump on one screen until you’ve found them all.</p>

<p>There’s no real plot to this game - it’s just a treasure hunt. Dropping and picking up items is pretty important though as you need to collect the various treasures, but you can only carry so many items at once.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/advland/010.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Having the visualization of the scene is useful as it can give you clues as well. It’s not obvious that you “extinguish” the lamp when you’re not using it by issuing a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UNLIGHT LAMP</code> command - until you enter the maze and see that verb on the wall. I’m assuming this would be presented in the original TRS-80 text adventure as just part of the scene description, but I appreciated this additional use of the “eye candy” to convey practical information.</p>

<p>Speaking of the TRS-80 version, <a href="https://archive.org/details/softside-magazine-22/page/n35/mode/2up?view=theater">SoftSide magazine’s July, 1980 edition</a> included the full TRS-80 source code that you could manually type out yourself!</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/advland/018.png" alt="" />
<em>Oh I see, I just need to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAM LAVA</code> to proceed. So obvious …</em></p>

<p>For a graphical adventure game released in 1982 the game is what you’d expect. The static scenes aren’t bad, the parser is extremely limited and some of the verb/object combinations are a bit cumbersome to come up with, but overall the game does a good job of guiding you.</p>

<p>There are no sound effects or music or story - and the game is incredibly short. It took me about half an hour to work through this, though the <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/23143">How Long To Beat</a> timing is apparently only 5 minutes.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/advland/020.png" alt="" />
<em>Find all 13 treasures, drop them in the stump … and that’s all she wrote</em></p>

<p>To make this game a bit more challenging there are a handful of ways you can die (ex: carrying the mud to the screen where the dragon is). When this happens you wind up in Limbo, where you just walk through a door that results in you “restarting” the game from the beginning. You can also reach a dead end by doing certain actions too early (ex: chopping down the tree before climbing it to pick up the skeleton keys).</p>

<p>This is a very early adventure game - and an improvement to an <em>even EARLIER</em> adventure game at that! It doesn’t really do anything new or innovative compared to other games released around this time so I can’t find any reason to recommend it. If you feel ambitious and want to type out the source code, go for it - or head on over to this <a href="https://github.com/ahope1/Beeb-Adventureland">GitHub repository</a> instead ;) There’s a great companion article called <a href="https://ahopeful.wordpress.com/2020/09/13/digging-up-adventureland-scott-adams-1980/">“Digging up Adventureland (Scott Adams, 1980)”</a> that details the creation of that BBC BASIC port of the TRS-80 code.</p>
