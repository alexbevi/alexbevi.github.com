<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/pull/3315"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cloudflare/workerd#3315</code></a>: add node:net module</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/pull/3594"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cloudflare/workerd#3594</code></a>: implement TLSSocket and connect from node:tls</li>
</ul>

<p>Were these changes sufficient to make Cloudflare Workers and MongoDB Atlas work together? Let’s revisit the example from the previous blog post to verify:</p>

<p>To test the code above you would need to do the following:</p>

<p>This will launch <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/">Wrangler</a>, the CLI for working with Cloudflare Workers.</p>

<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>

<p>Now that our worker is running locally, it should be accessible via http://localhost:8787. The worker logic we wrote in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wrangler.ts</code> should perform the following actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>connect to the MongoDB cluster via the connection string configured in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONGODB_URI</code> environment variable (setup in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wrangler.toml</code>)</li>
  <li>drop the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test_workers</code> collection in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test</code> database</li>
  <li>insert a new document in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test_workers</code> collection</li>
  <li>retrieve the inserted document from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test_workers</code> collection</li>
  <li>return a JSON representation of that document</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s try it out and see what happens:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>SUCCESS!</p>

<p>We were able to connect to our cluster (using <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/fundamentals/authentication/mechanisms/">SCRAM authentication</a>) to interact with our data via the MongoDB Node.js driver from a Worker.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Excitement for Cloudflare Workers support for MongoDB has been around in the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/t/cloudflare-workers-integration-is-now-possible/226708">MongoDB developer forums</a> since May, 2023. As the Product Manager for MongoDB’s JavaScript developer experience I’ve possibly been making more noise about this issue than most - including the initial blog post. I shared this with the Cloudflare team in a <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/6684">bug report on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">workers-sdk</code></a>, which ultimately triggered a <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/discussions/2721">discussion on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">workerd</code> project</a> that may have prompted the ensuing engineering effort.</p>

<p>I really look forward to seeing the amazing things this integration can unlock for MongoDB developers that want to take advantage of the power and flexibility of Cloudflare Workers!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="MongoDB" /><category term="mongodb" /><category term="drivers" /><category term="node" /><category term="nodejs" /><category term="javascript" /><category term="typescript" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Previously I wrote about Why Cloudflare Workers Don’t Work With MongoDB, but since then the Cloudflare team has done some great work to add support for the missing Node.js features MongoDB’s driver required to operate successfully from Cloudflare Workers:]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.alexbevi.com/images/mongodb-cloudflare.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.alexbevi.com/images/mongodb-cloudflare.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Universe (Core Design) - 1994</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2025/02/02/universe/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Universe (Core Design) - 1994" /><published>2025-02-02T07:56:58-05:00</published><updated>2025-02-13T06:09:50-05:00</updated><id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2025/02/02/universe</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2025/02/02/universe/"><![CDATA[<blockquote class="prompt-info">

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe_(1994_video_game)">Universe</a> is a graphic adventure game developed and published by Core Design for the Amiga, Amiga CD32 and DOS platforms in 1994. It was Core Design’s second and last effort in the adventure game genre after Curse of Enchantia, of which it was originally planned to be a sequel.</p>

<p>Universe is a space opera that tells the story of Boris, a young man who has been summoned from modern Earth to another universe, where he is destined to become its long forecast savior from evil. The game received mostly positive reviews.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/006.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You are Boris Verne, a normal guy who has been cast in a parallel universe because of your uncle’s Virtual Dimension Inducer. There you’ll have to find the fabled lost star as well as a way to defeat the Golden King… This is a classic old-style adventure game with a point &amp; click interface. It uses the Rotoscope system to manage game characters and scores really beautiful 256-colour graphic.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/000.png" alt="" />
<em>Another release from the fine folks at <a href="https://demozoo.org/productions/254430/">Prestige</a></em></p>

<p>This is the first game on my list that I’ve tackled so far that was available on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_CD32">Amiga CD32</a>, so I figured it would be worth trying to play through that version if possible.</p>

<p>I’ve been using <a href="https://dirkwhoffmann.github.io/vAmiga/">vAmiga</a> for my Amiga games, but I couldn’t get CD32 working (it’s possibly just not supported). I then tried <a href="https://fs-uae.net/">FS-UAE</a>, but didn’t have a kickstart ROM for it … so I ended up just watching a bit of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP0uQl4W8aQ">longplay on YouTube</a> just to get a sense of what’s different.</p>

<p>Seems the only difference was CD quality audio, which comes through nicely in the videos. The sound design in this game is pretty good, so even without the CD audio the ambient background music did a great job of setting the tone for each scene in the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/002.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Since the game starts off with a long intro sequence (which is also spelled out in the <a href="https://dn790003.ca.archive.org/0/items/universe-manual/Universe%20-%20Manual-DE-ENG-FR-IT.pdf">manual</a>) I sort of expected the story to take place across multiple chapters - but maybe the chapter in this case referred to the whole game and subsequent chapters would have been sequels.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/004.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After the intro you find yourself stranded all alone in space. There’s a futuristic city behind you that you can’t reach, and if you wander off in the other direction you can fall off onto a barren planet surface you can explore.</p>

<p>The game’s interface is fairly intuitive if you’ve played Point and Click Adventure games in the past, as you’ll be given a verb bar with common actions you can perform (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PICK UP</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TALK</code>, etc). There is an additional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OPTIONS</code> item that links to a submenu of actions such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">THROW</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JUMP</code>and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INSERT</code>.</p>

<p>You’ll find you actually use these additional actions a lot more that the primary actions, so you’ll be clicking through to the submenu fairly frequently.</p>

<p>This submenu also includes an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INFO</code> item which goes to a third submenu where you can save/load your game or redisplay the initial scene info. This is useful if you accidentally clicked away the description when you first entered the screen.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/010.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you figure out how to navigate the game world (including jumping to the spinning rock, then jumping back to the floating platform) and extend the bridge to the first town, you’ll be able to explore the game world a bit further.</p>

<p>Universe is visually impressive, and most scenes are extremely detailed in all their pixel-art glory. When you’re not roaming around looking for items to pick up, you’ll engage with various alien races using a fairly straightforward conversation system.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/009.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you progress through the game, there are occasionally “cut scenes” that help progress the plot. Boris will have to escape the first world and head towards the Wheelworld to learn more about the tyrannical Emperor Neiamises, the secret order of the Healers and Baron Keelev.</p>

<p>For adventure game fans, the story really takes center stage and makes the gameplay just a vehicle through which the story can unfold.</p>

<p>This game feels like it’s going to be a massive, sweeping experience as you’re playing through it, but there’s actually not all that much you need to do.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/013.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are several items you’ll need to pick up as you explore, and the game does include a few item combination style puzzles as a result. Examining most items will make it fairly apparent what you’re supposed to do with them though, so you typically won’t find yourself scratching your head for too long trying to figure out what to do next.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/038.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>One of the nice touches of Universe is the fact that the cursor will change into a thumbs up or thumbs down based on the action you just performed. Given how bad the pathfinding can be on some screens, it’s very easy to issue a command and then Boris sort of just stands there until you move a little in one direction and try again.</p>

<p>Since the cursor will change to indicate success or failure, if you try something and it works but nothing happens, you know you just need to try it again from a different position to progress.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/027.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For anyone that’s played this style of game before, it’s not overly difficult - but there are couple of arcade sequences that can be a pain in the ass.</p>

<p>On the Wheelworld you’ll meed a healer who’s had their hand stolen by thieves that take off on jetpacks. You’ll need to jump into your PTV and fly after them, shooting them down or running them into the sides of buildings.</p>

<p>It’s very easy to die in this sequence and I must have done it a dozen or so times before I finally got through it. It wasn’t fun - it was just sort of tedious.</p>

<p>I appreciate when adventure games have the self awareness to allow you to skip these sequences (like you can skip playing poker in Police Quest 1), but Universe isn’t one of those games.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/028.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When Boris dies (and he will), the game over screen makes fun of your incompetence and will occasionally give you a clue as to what you should have done instead. You can really feel the inspiration from Sierra Online here.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/041.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Like with any adventure game, save early and save often. Since I was playing the Amiga version, this mean having to eject the game disk, insert the save disk, save, eject and reinsert the game disk again. Modern gamers are so spoiled …</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/012.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are a number of planets you’ll be able to explore once you have access to a PTV. Each planet you have access requires you to go through the same motions of navigating to it, descending to it, picking a quadrant to explore, then exploring.</p>

<p>When you first get access to the map of the Universe it can feel a bit daunting, but most of the  available planets has very little to do or see. You’ll need to backtrack occasionally to solve fetch quests or after you’ve unlocked various story elements to open up new dialogue options with certain characters.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/048.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Aside from running back and forth between a handful of planets, the majority of this game’s plot advances through conversations with various characters you’ll meet along the way. Boris will slowly learn more about his place in the Universe and that he’s expected to take down the Emperor.</p>

<p>Character interactions occur via a branching dialogue system, which frequently will result in a game over if you pick the wrong options. Though having to reload can be frustrating, the feedback the game gives you when Boris dies is at least entertaining.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/039.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Universe is mostly straightforward, but the final sequences ratchet up the complexity. You’ll need to figure out how to open a portal to another dimension to retrieve a power stone. Once you find the various pieces you’ll need (on multiple planets), <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">COMBINE</code> them and use them in the right place, you’ll need to solve a puzzle.</p>

<p>This puzzle involves running over various stones to disable 6 lasers, but if you don’t do it fast enough, they reset and you start over. This took … forever. Once you are able to do it, you have to throw a rock at the power stone, then pick it up and run so you’re not immediately captured by a bunch of ghosts.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/051.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>With the power stone in hand and back in the right dimension, you’ll make your way into the Emperor’s palace, navigate a short maze, expose the Baron for wanting to steal the Emperor’s power, then once the Baron is vanquished, defeat the Emperor.</p>

<p>Yay, you’ve saved the Universe and your uncle shows up to take you back home.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/universe/058.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Universe was surprisingly good. I’d never heard of this game and didn’t know what to expect, but the story and characters drew me in immediately. The game is beautiful, the sound effects and ambient music are fitting and really enhance the gaming experience.</p>

<p>Having watched a couple of let’s plays of the game it seems you can burn through it in a couple hours if you know what you’re doing - but to just explore the Universe and naturally experience the game takes much longer.</p>

<p>The star of this show is definitely the story, and you can feel the Star Wars influences throughout. I found myself getting caught up in the plot and looking forward to uncovering more details about the worlds I was exploring and the characters I’d meet.</p>

<p>If you love this genre and are looking to experience a great Point and Click Adventure you likely wouldn’t have, give Universe a go. You won’t be disappointed (though you may occasionally be frustrated).</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer_(video_game)">Neuromancer</a> is an adventure video game developed by Interplay Productions and published by Mediagenic (a brand name of Activision). It was released in 1988 for the Amiga, Apple II, Apple IIGS, Commodore 64, and MS-DOS. It was loosely based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer">William Gibson’s 1984 novel of the same name</a> and set within both the fictional “real world” and the extensively realized and detailed world of cyberspace.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/062.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In a grimy future, you play Case, a cyberspace cowboy who finds himself broke in Chiba City. Find yourself a laptop and the right software for it so you can hack into databases around the city to regain your access to cyberspace. Buy and upgrade brain implant chips to augment your computer skills, and sell your body parts to afford new technologies. When you get to cyberspace, you’ll take on the nasty AIs that guard the most important databases. Within all this information is the bizarre secret of this world of inbred corporations.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/038.png" alt="" />
<em>I played the Amiga version, which starts off with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT7sXsoFpZA">Paradox cracktro</a></em></p>

<p>Though I haven’t re-read the source material in well over 20 years, I have very fond memories of Neuromancer. That book kicked off a lifelong love of the cyberpunk genre, so I’ve been looking forward to playing this game since I kicked off this series.</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem to follow the events of the book at all, but definitely exists in the same universe. You start off in a bar, where you apparently spent the night that you owe the bartender money for.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/041.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You’ll also have a chance to explore the limited interface, which includes a PAX button. PAX is sort of like a basic bulletin board system, that you can read news on or access your banking information. Since you start with no money in hand, you’ll need to access your bank account and transfer all your money.</p>

<p>From the initial PAX screen you’ll learn some link codes, and also that someone named Shin has your cyberdeck.</p>

<p>Since I played a cracked version I didn’t need to refer to the <a href="https://www.c64sets.com/details_db.html?id=3227&amp;t=Neuromancer&amp;i=PAX%20verification%20code%20wheel">code wheel</a> that you’d typically need to access the PAX.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/045.png" alt="" />
<em>Yes, that’s a door below you you’ll need to go through</em></p>

<p>Navigating the game world is done using the mouse. It’s not always obvious what/where the exit to a room is, especially when there’s door at the bottom of the screen. Once you get used to keeping an eye out for these tiny slivers of doorway though it’s not too difficult to navigate the game world.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/048.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The majority of the game is spent “online”. You’ll need to first get your deck back from Shin, then find a location that has jack you can use. The most convenient location for this is the Cheap Hotel, and you’ll spend a good portion of the game here navigating various online systems, then eventually cyberspace.</p>

<p>Gaining access to a system requires a link code and a password. These are scattered throughout various messages you can read online, and are fairly straightforward to find - just make sure you write them down.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/042.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Going online costs money, and the longer you spend online - the more money you’ll gradually lose. Gaining additional money in this game can be done in one of two ways. Either you find an account online you can transfer money out of (into your account), or you sell body parts.</p>

<p>At the Body Shop, you can incrementally sell off your body parts for cash. The more parts you sell, the lower your HP (constitution?) will drop. You’ll need this later in the game when you need to start attacking databases and ICE, but you can buy your body parts back as you get more money to regain your HP.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/067.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You piece the plot of the game and your objectives together slowly by reading through the various messages on each system you gain access to. There aren’t really that many actions you can take on these systems other than reading through the contents, but many will have software (“softwarez”) libraries you can access.</p>

<p>Your deck has limited storage, so you’ll need to be mindful of what software you’re carrying and how much space you have available. As you download better versions of your software, you can delete the older versions to make room.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/052.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are a handful of characters and machines you can interact with as well using the conversation system. Typically these involve cycling through a pre-determined list of options you can ask them about, but some also have a free-form text field you can fill out.</p>

<p>This allows you to ask about specific topics, which you’ll either learn from other characters or from the messages you read on bulletin boards.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/056.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The more time you spend online, the lower your finances will fall. Thankfully there are a couple of opportunities to infiltrate banks and transfer (steal) fairly large balances of credits to your account.</p>

<p>You’ll need this money to purchase skills, upgrade your cyberdeck and buy various items. If you successfully complete these missions, remember to access your account via the PAX to download your credits so you can go shopping.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/060.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though there aren’t that many items in the game you need to interact with, there are a couple of fetch quests you’ll need to undertake. These typically just involve going back and forth between characters and asking questions, or going online and changing some information about a character to get them arrested (so they’re not blocking a doorway).</p>

<p>For this playthrough I found myself leaning on the <a href="https://www.walkthroughking.com/text/neuromancer.aspx">walkthrough</a> pretty heavily for these sequences as it wasn’t always obvious what I was supposed to do.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/068.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you upgrade your deck to one that can access cyberspace, you’ll be able to jack into the matrix and access various databases. Similar to the sites you have access to via the comlink systems, once you enter a database you’ll be able to read messages and download software.</p>

<p>The difference though is you’ll need to defeat the ICE (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_Countermeasures_Electronics">Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics</a>) first.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/080.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Fighting ICE is done with ICE-breaking software. This software is classified loosely into 3 categories: Good, Better and Best - which you’ll learn from one of the message boards.</p>

<p>The manual sort of calls out that ICE-breaking requires a lot of trial and error, and the best way to gain access to a database is to just try various combinations to see what’s effective. As a result, make sure you save before each battle - just in case.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/072.png" alt="" />
<em>Death is not permanent - but it is expensive</em></p>

<p>If you fail to break the ICE and experience brain death, you’ll respawn in the Body Shop - minus all your money. This is VERY difficult to recover from, so you’re better off to just reload a previous save and try again.</p>

<p>Assuming you haven’t sold all your body parts, you could do this to gain a little extra cash, but honestly it’s not worth it … just reload.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/088.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Your objective will ultimately be to seek out and destroy all the AI in cyberspace. There are two competing AI - Greystroke and Neuromancer - that are trying to get the other to join them to dominate cyberspace. At least that’s what I think is happening …</p>

<p>Each AI is hidden behind an ICE you’ll need to break, and the later in the game you get, the harder they are. One aspect of this game that I didn’t realize was that you’ll need to jack out of cyberspace periodically to recover your HP.</p>

<p>After each ice confrontation if you try to access another database, it looks like your “health” is full - but it actually isn’t.</p>

<p>I think it was after I’d just barely gained access to the KGB system, I moved onto the next database and found no matter what I tried, I’d die in one shot. It must have taken me a few weeks of on-and-off messing around reading other reviews and blogs (like the <a href="https://advgamer.blogspot.com/2013/07/game-32-neuromancer-oceans-one.html">Adventurer’s Guild review</a>) before I finally realized this was what you needed to do.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/092.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Defeating AIs is done with “skills”, which you buy and upgrade throughout the game. When you finally beat Neuromancer, you’ll be thrown onto a beach - which is just an illusion that it has created to trap you.</p>

<p>Using some combination of skills allows you to escape, and once you do so you’ll have officially finished the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/neuromancer/094.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Overall, Neuromancer is a fun game. There are a handful of distinct gameplay mechanics that aren’t that hard to learn, but do take a while to master.</p>

<p>There is occasionally background music, which isn’t bad - though I think it plays more prominently in other versions (like the C64). The Amiga version I played was mostly quiet, save for the title screen and once in a while.</p>

<p>I’m fairly certain this was one of the first games I started playing for this series, but I did so using <a href="https://apple2.gs/plus/">GSPLUS</a> and had a number of issues that made the experience cumbersome. I really want to experience as many of these games on as many emulated systems as possible, so I stubbornly just kept trying to make the GSPLUS experience happen - and it wouldn’t - so I gave up on the game for a number of years.</p>

<p>I’m really glad I circled back to it, as it really is a lot of fun. Though the similarities are not obvious, playing Neuromancer actually sort of reminded me a bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uplink_(video_game)">Uplink: Hacker Elite</a> - which I LOVE! I think it’s just the whole “cruising cyberspace and hacking” simulation portion of the game, but I found both to be equally enjoyable so figured it was worth calling out.</p>

<p>There was an attempt to reverse engineer and reimplement this game for Windows called <a href="https://github.com/HenadziMatuts/Reuromancer">Reuromancer</a>, however I’m not sure how playable this engine actually is. If you have Google Translate, the <a href="https://habr.com/post/352050/">development blog</a> (which is in Russian) is a great read.</p>

<p>I would highly recommend giving this game a chance. It can be extremely difficult and unforgiving, but if you like to read, the story is interesting and the gameplay is fairly accessible.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for something to read instead, go grab the book!</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_of_the_Phantom">Return of the Phantom</a> is a point-and-click graphic adventure game developed and published by MicroProse in 1993. It was produced by Matt Gruson and designed/written by future James Bond novelist Raymond Benson. It is based on the 1910 novel The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_(novel)">Phantom of the Opera</a> by Gaston Leroux.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_017.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game was the second graphical adventure game developed by MicroProse, following Rex Nebular and preceding Dragonsphere. It was developed using the MicroProse Adventure Development system (MADS), and made use of 256-colour graphics. A CD version featuring full voices for the characters was also released - which is the version I played.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_023.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It is the present time (1993), and many people are about to enjoy the performance of the opera “Don Juan Triumphant” at the Palais Garnier. However, that piece of art will soon become covered with the blood of innocents, as the great ceiling chandelier crushes down on the crowd.</p>

<p>The player controls Raoul Montand, a detective who’s been asked for help by his old friend Monsieur Brie, the manager of the Opera. Bringing Raoul to a crime scene, he leaves him in hope he’ll find some clues and prevent this terror from happening again. Supposedly, the disaster was caused by a being known as the Phantom of the Opera, a mysterious creature who has been haunting the opera house since 1881. The detective is about to find out what secrets lie beneath the surface, looking for clues in the present time and traveling back to 1881.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game’s intro sequence is extremely long, but it sets the stage appropriately. Though I’ve heard of the Phantom of the Opera and have seen it live at lest once in my life, the first thing that jumped out was how little I actually knew about the story.</p>

<p>My memories seem limited to just the character in the mask and cape that lives in the basement and plays the organ … so really you could have replaced the Phantom with literally anything else and this game’s story would have had the same impact.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_006.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you gain control of Raoul following the intro, you walk around the opera house and can interact with a handful of characters. These sequences are the typical dialogue trees you’ll find in other adventure games, and they help advance the plot and give you clues as to what you need to do next.</p>

<p>If you play the CD version of the game, these interactions are all fully voice acted - and the voice acting isn’t all that bad. Aside from a couple actors hamming it up a little, they definitely add to the experience and make interrogations more enjoyable.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_010.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Moving around the opera house is pretty straightforward, and exits are clear marked. If you can go in some direction, the cursor will change to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GO</code> icon with an arrow indicating which direction you can move in.</p>

<p>You also have a verb list to select from, though you’ll predominantly just be using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TALK TO</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TAKE</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_014.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game is split up into three parts. The first part has you roaming about the opera house and talking to people, learning about the history of the Phantom and getting used to the game. Eventually you’ll make your way up to the rafters, where you encounter the Phantom, get into a fight and he throws you off.</p>

<p>You’ll hit your head, and when you wake up you’ve traveled back in time to 1881 and have a completely different Phantom of the Opera mystery to solve.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_015.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This second part of the game is just an extension of the first - but in the past. I believe you’re trying to change the events of the original Phantom of the Opera to prevent a murder in your present time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_019.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game then becomes a series of fetch quests and interrogations. You’ll find out that the  Phantom is leaving notes that indicate what his demands are in a private opera box that should always be locked. Madame Giry has the only key assures you the box is locked, but somehow the Phantom is able to come and go as he pleases.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_020.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Since this game takes place in an opera house, eventually you’ll get a chance to watch the opera - but first you’ll need to find some items from your time. Madame Giry seems to know you’re from a different time, and for some reason even though you’ve got a ticket to the opera she won’t unlock the door until you fetch these items.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_016.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You’ll find coloured frames in the opera, which are for changing the colour of the lighting. These wouldn’t exist in 1881 so it’s weird you can find them - but they’re here - and you need to find at least 3 of them to proceed.</p>

<p>The leading lady - who looks exactly like the leading lady in the present - gets kidnapped and you’ll then need to go find her.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_024.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This game really holds your hand for the most part. Every time you need to do something to progress, the character interactions make it very clear what your next objective is. You’ll never feel lost, and if you do backtracking isn’t a major issue as there are only about a dozen or so screens to navigate.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_026.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You’ll be told to go find Jacques, who you’ll find has been murdered. Next to him is a skeleton key (how convenient), which you can use to unlock the secret door in box 5, which is how the Phantom has been coming and going undetected.</p>

<p>This will lead you under the opera to the catacombs, which is a giant maze.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_028.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though I hate mazes, the catacombs were fairly straightforward. There is nothing chasing you and I don’t think there’s any risk of dying, so I turned DOSBox to turbo and just wandered about (very quickly) until I found where I needed to go.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_030.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To escape the catacombs you’ll need to solve a couple of puzzles. This is the only place in the game where there are puzzles, so it was a nice change of pace and didn’t feel (too much) like busywork.</p>

<p>The first puzzle requires you to flip 4 switches in order to unlock the door. The switches hide letters of the alphabet, but what word should you try? The Phantom’s real name is Erik, so it seemed logical that that’s what the password would be.</p>

<p>If you enter the letters out of order or incorrectly, gas enters the room through a vent and kills you. Thankfully, death in this game just respawns you in the current room and you can try again.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_032.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The second puzzle is a sliding tile puzzle where you need to recreate the Phantom’s mask. Once done correctly, a trap door opens in the floor you can escape through. This is done by combining a hook and rope to make a grappling hook, which you can <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">THROW</code> to climb out.</p>

<p>You don’t actually have to interact much with your inventory but I found the system worked rather well when you did. Whenever you find a new item, you’ll automatically <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code> at it, so if it’s a letter or note, you’ll read it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_027.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you select an item in your inventory, there’s a preview image of it in one view, with a set of targeted verbs specifically for that item in a second view.</p>

<p>I really like this system as it allows for a larger verb list without cluttering the main interface. It also makes it obvious what you can do with an item.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_036.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The final showdown with the Phantom eventually takes place on top of the chandelier above the seats in the opera (the one that crashed down at the beginning of the game). There’s a bit of a scuffle, you get on top of the Phantom, rip off his mask and the chandelier comes crashing down.</p>

<p>You then wake up back in the present.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_038.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After a brief exchange, Raoul decides to double check the book in the library to see how the Phantom died, and the ending has apparently now been changed. You’re the hero of the past, though you apparently also died in the fall along with the Phantom.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/phantom/mainmenu_041.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I really don’t know anything noteworthy about the source material this game is based on, and didn’t find the story all that interesting. Though there’s a time travel story here, it sort of felt out of place. The entire game basically takes place in 1881, and the events of the present really aren’t necessary.</p>

<p>The game engine is quite good, and hopefully one day this will be <a href="https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Return_of_the_Phantom">officially supported in ScummVM</a> - but for now you can play this just fine in DOSBox.</p>

<p>Overall the game was fine, but I wouldn’t play it again.</p>

  <p>Download the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QwTpalK0Zn5ddMlDOLlRwBrUQUW2S0BqZGddmaGb8x8/edit">Hockey Team Budget Template</a> discussed in this article</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve been the treasurer for a couple minor hockey teams for the past five years, and though there are resources available to the parents that choose to assume this role on their kids’ teams, if you aren’t comfortable with accounting or working with spreadsheets the task can be daunting.</p>

<p>Every minor hockey association will make some resources available, and <a href="https://www.hockeycanada.ca/en-ca/hockey-programs/mha/downloads">Hockey Canada’s MHA downloads</a> currently include a minor hockey budget sheet (<a href="https://cdn.hockeycanada.ca/hockey-canada/Hockey-Programs/MHA/downloads/minor-hockey-budget-sheets-e.xls">XLS</a> and <a href="https://cdn.hockeycanada.ca/hockey-canada/Hockey-Programs/MHA/downloads/minor-hockey-budget-sheets-instructions-e.pdf">instructions</a>), but again, these really aren’t designed to do anything more than summarize the team’s finances - not track or manage them.</p>

<p>Since team treasurers aren’t only accountable to the league and their team’s association, but also the parents it’s important to not only have accurate accounting of revenue and expenses, but also a way to provide transparency.</p>

<p>The money you’re handling isn’t yours - it belongs to everyone on the team. If anyone has questions as to what’s being spent on what or how much is left it shouldn’t be hard to answer.</p>

<p>To try and make this easier for future team managers and treasurers I’ve created the following <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QwTpalK0Zn5ddMlDOLlRwBrUQUW2S0BqZGddmaGb8x8/edit">Hockey Team Budget Template</a>. Feel free to download/copy/use, and if you have any feedback or questions, shoot me a message.</p>

<p>I’ll be going into some detail below as to how you can use this spreadsheet to do the following:</p>

  <li>Setup the Team’s Budget</li>
  <li>Manage Parent Payment Schedules</li>
  <li>Manage Revenue and Expenses</li>
  <li>Manage a Cash Float</li>

<h2 id="setup-the-teams-budget">Setup the Team’s Budget</h2>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241227130902.png" alt="" />
<em>Figure 1: Budget</em></p>

<p>As the team treasurer, the first thing you need to work out with the team manager and head coach is how much money the season is going to cost.</p>

<p>Most of the information can be copied from previous seasons, but since prices are subject to change year over year you want to always estimate high. For example, if you paid $30K the previous year you may want to bump that to $34K this year (just in case). Always try to estimate a bit high, as he parents on the team have to pay for the season and it’s easier to refund extra money than it is to go back and ask for more 😉.</p>

<p>Each section below will match one or more of the numbered sections in <em>Figure 1</em> above.</p>

<h3 id="1-figure-out-how-much-youll-need-to-spend">(1) Figure out how much you’ll need to spend</h3>

<p>Some expenses to consider when making the budget are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Association fees</li>
  <li>Practice/game ice fees</li>
  <li>Jersey/Sock costs</li>
  <li>Referee fees</li>
  <li>Timekeeper fees</li>
  <li>Tryout fees</li>
  <li>Extra ice rental fees</li>
  <li>Tournament fees</li>
  <li>Goalie training</li>
  <li>Extra training (on-ice or off-ice) and team building</li>
  <li>Social budget (Christmas and end of season parties)</li>
  <li>Player gifts</li>
  <li>Police checks, coaches clinics, certification and training costs</li>
  <li>Trainer supplies</li>
  <li>Coaches apparel</li>
</ul>

<p>Not all of these are required, but can be used as a starting point.  Under the <em>Expenses</em> section of the <strong>Budget</strong> sheet, just add a new row for each line item you want to track, then copy the first line item as many times as you need</p>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241227132156.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you add new rows to the <em>Expenses</em> section, the total budget should be automatically updated on the last row of the sheet.</p>

<h3 id="2-figure-out-how-much-money-youll-need-to-cover-costs">(2) Figure out how much money you’ll need to cover costs</h3>

<p>Once you have your total expenses plugged in, you’ll need to make sure you collect at least that much money from the parents on the team.</p>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241227155003.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For example, if your total expenses are $96,130.00 for the season, you’ll likely want to collect at least $97,000.00.</p>

<p>Fundraising and sponsorships can never be guaranteed, but if the team agrees on a certain minimum threshold, plugging those values in will ensure you have enough money to cover costs.</p>

<p>From the example above I expect to collect $95,000.00 from the parents directly, with another $10,000.00 from sponsorship and donations, for a total budget of <strong>$105,000.000</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="3-5-updates-will-be-automatically-tracked-as-transactions-are-recorded">(3-5) Updates will be automatically tracked as transactions are recorded</h3>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241227155505.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The actual amount of money we’ve collected and spent will be summarized automatically based on how we record revenue and expenses on the <strong>Transactions</strong> sheet. We will also include details for other sources of income that may be harder to track, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Current bank balance</li>
  <li>Cash on hand</li>
  <li>Total value of outstanding (uncashed) cheques</li>
</ul>

<p>This gives us a snapshot of our current financials at all times throughout the season. If everything is adding up correctly, the <em>DIFF</em> field should be $0.</p>

<h3 id="6-expense-category-budgets-can-be-automatically-tracked-as-well">(6) Expense category budgets can be automatically tracked as well</h3>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241227155843.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We’ll need to know how much money we’ve spent in each category as the season goes on - especially if/when we go over.</p>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241227161336.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once the <em>Budget Left</em> reaches zero, you’ve met or exceeded the budget. I’ve configured <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/78413?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop">conditional formatting rules</a> so it stands out a bit more that you’ve dropped below 50% of your budget.</p>

<h2 id="manage-parent-payment-schedules">Manage Parent Payment Schedules</h2>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241227161737.png" alt="" />
<em>Figure 2: Roster</em></p>

<p>Most (if not all) the money for the season comes from the parents on the team, so it’s important to understand how much money that will be, and to keep up with payments.</p>

<p>Once you know how much each parent will need to pay, you can work backwards from when all fees should be due to figure out a schedule.</p>

<p>For our example, we’ll be collecting <strong>$6,125.00</strong> from each family. If the team was finalized in March, and we want all fees to be collected by December, a schedule such as the following might make sense:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>June 10</strong></td>
      <td><strong>CA$800.00</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>July 10</strong></td>
      <td><strong>CA$800.00</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Aug 10</strong></td>
      <td><strong>CA$1,000.00</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Sep 10</strong></td>
      <td><strong>CA$1,000.00</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Oct 10</strong></td>
      <td><strong>CA$1,000.00</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Nov 10</strong></td>
      <td><strong>CA$1,000.00</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Dec 10</strong></td>
      <td><strong>CA$525.00</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="1-5-6-7-per-player-payment-tracking">(1, 5, 6, 7) Per-player payment tracking</h3>

<p>Fill out the team roster first. Only the <em>Last Name</em> is actually used elsewhere, and the values for <em>Direct Payments</em>, <em>Other Payments (Not Reimbursed)</em>, <em>Paid</em>, and <em>Reimbursements</em> will be calculated for you based on what is recorded in the <strong>Transactions</strong> sheet.</p>

<p>The <em>Outstanding</em> value will begin from what you input as <em>Total (Per Player Rounded)</em> and subtract these transactions to help keep track of what each parent still owes.</p>

<p>To clarify terminology:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Direct Payments</em>: E-Transfers or cash from parents that are applied directly to player fees</li>
  <li><em>Other Payments (Not Reimbursed)</em>: Costs parents cover that can be subtracted from fees (ex: they paid for pizza for the team for a social event)</li>
  <li><em>Reimbursements</em>: When parents have paid <em>more</em> than the expected fees, and you want to refund them the overage amount directly</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-3-4-total-expected-revenue-from-parent-collections">(2, 3, 4) Total expected revenue from parent collections</h3>

<p>Based on what we calculated in our <strong>Budget</strong> sheet earlier, we were going to collect <strong>$95,000.00</strong> from parents, so this is imported to the <em>Total Expected (Imported)</em> field.</p>

<p>We’ve only rostered 16 players this season, so we enter that value into the <em>Total Players</em> field, which we divide the total expected value from to figured out the <em>Expected Per Player</em> total.</p>

<p>Once again, it’s easier to refund money at the end of the season than it is to ask for more money if unexpected costs occur, so round up the per-player value slightly to come up with the final <em>Total (Per Player Rounded)</em> value you’ll be collecting from parents.</p>

<p>This final value will then be multiplied by the number of players on the team to give you the final <em>Total Expected</em> value.</p>

<h2 id="manage-revenue-and-expenses">Manage Revenue and Expenses</h2>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241228091709.png" alt="" />
<em>Figure 3: Transactions</em></p>

<p>The <strong>Transactions</strong> sheet is where day to day revenue and expenses are recorded. If everything is setup properly, just keeping this sheet updated will likely be sufficient to manage your reporting for the season.</p>

<p>When you setup your <strong>Budget</strong>, each line item under <em>Expenses</em> will be available via the <em>Category</em> dropdown when you want to record a transaction now.</p>

<p>Let’s walk through some examples of recording to get a feeling for how this works.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1: Parent paid directly for team related expense</strong>
<img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241228105045.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here we can a <strong>Preseason: Tryout Related Expenses</strong> was recorded for <strong>$54.00</strong> by a member of the <strong>Boyle</strong> family. The <em>Paid By</em> dropdown is populated by the <em>Last Name</em> of each player on the <strong>Roster</strong> sheet.</p>

<p>When you specify a family under the <em>Paid By</em> column, that payment will be deducted from that player’s fees automatically. This makes it easier to keep track of how much money that family still owes towards fees if they’re contributing in other ways.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2: Parent paid their monthly dues directly</strong>
<img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241228172309.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When <strong>Parent Contributions</strong> is selected, the assumption is you’re recording a direct payment towards fees. If you check off the checkbox under the <em>Cash?</em> column, it will be recorded not only as a parent contribution, but will help keep track of your cash float.</p>

<p><strong>Example 3: Paying for an expense with a cheque</strong>
<img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241228172543.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Most teams don’t have access to E-Transfer out of a community (or team) account, and will need to pay for things with cheques. In this case, you just enter the cheque number in the <em>Chq</em> column - and once the cheque has been cashed, click off the <em>Chq. Cashed?</em> checkbox.</p>

<p>Under the <strong>Budget</strong> sheet there is a <em>Uncashed</em> section under <em>Revenue</em> where you can quickly see how much money you have outstanding in cheques that you haven’t reconciled in your bank statement yet.</p>

<h2 id="manage-a-cash-float">Manage a Cash Float</h2>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241228172904.png" alt="" />
<em>Figure 4: Cash Float</em></p>

<p>If your game officials and timekeepers are paid in cash, you’ll likely need to also manage a cash float. As money comes in from parents, some of that can be requested in cash, which when recorded in the <strong>Transactions</strong> sheet as <em>Cash?</em> will automatically be updated in the <em>Current Cash</em> field on your <strong>Cash Float</strong> sheet.</p>

<p>Periodically I’ll do a count, which I record as a line item broken down by each individual denomination I have in the float. If my <em>Total</em> matches the <em>Current Cash</em> - everything’s accounted for!</p>

<h2 id="manage-bank-transactions">Manage Bank Transactions</h2>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241229071015.png" alt="" />
<em>Figure 5: Bank Balance</em></p>

<p>I like to have all my teams’ finances in one place, so I’ll copy/paste transaction records from the online banking portal to the <strong>Bank Balance</strong> sheet.</p>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241229071405.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The last value in the <em>Balance</em> field on this sheet is what is reflected on the <strong>Budget</strong> sheet’s <em>Bank</em> value (using the formula <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=INDEX('Bank Balance'!D2:D,COUNTA('Bank Balance'!D2:D),1)</code>, for anyone that’s curious).</p>

<p>If you’re not looking to track things this granularly, the <strong>Bank Balance</strong> sheet can be ignored and you can just periodically copy the current balance from your bank statement directly into the <em>Bank</em> value of the <strong>Budget</strong> sheet.</p>

<h2 id="account-for-fundraising-and-sponsorships">Account for Fundraising and Sponsorships</h2>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241229071838.png" alt="" />
<em>Figure 6: Sponsorship &amp; Fundraising</em></p>

<p>Fundraising and sponsorships are a big way teams subsidize the cost of the season to take some of the financial burden off parents.</p>

<p>The <strong>Sponsorship &amp; Fundraising</strong> sheet doesn’t actually feed into any further automation, but is provided as a single location to keep track of these sources of income to make it easier to account for a lump sum you’ll eventually record under the <strong>Transactions</strong> sheet.</p>

<h2 id="revise-the-teams-budget">Revise the Team’s Budget</h2>

<p>When you setup the budget at the beginning of the season, you won’t know exactly how much additional money you may be able to raise or how many sponsorships you’ll get. There may also be some additional costs you didn’t anticipate, or potentially forgot all about.</p>

<p>As the season goes on, if you need to revise your budget, the most important thing to take into consideration is “can we afford this” - which should be a fairly easy question to answer.</p>

<p>As an example, let’s say we want to pay for team pictures which will cost <strong>$850.00</strong>. Using the <strong>Budget</strong> sheet, we’d do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add a line item under <em>EXPENSES</em> to add a new entry for <em>Team Pictures</em>, with a <em>Budget</em> of <strong>$850.00</strong></li>
  <li>Check our updated <em>TOTAL EXPENSES</em> to make sure it’s still below our <em>TOTAL REVENUE</em></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/images/hockey-budget/Pasted image 20241229074203.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I typically <em>italicize</em> expenses that are added after the final budget has been approved so it’s easier to differentiate these items.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Being the team treasurer is a volunteer position that comes with a lot of responsibility. At the end of the season, you’re responsible for reconciling the team’s budget and paying parents back for any money that remains.</p>

<p>Hopefully using the template I’ve provided will make it a little easier to do this. If you try it out, let me know if it worked for you. I’d love to hear if this makes managing your team’s finances easier 😃.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Hockey" /><category term="budget" /><category term="treasurer" /><category term="hockey" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Download the Hockey Team Budget Template discussed in this article]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.alexbevi.com/images/hockey-budget/banner.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.alexbevi.com/images/hockey-budget/banner.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Plan 9 from Outer Space (Gremlin Ireland) - 1992</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2024/12/22/plan-9-from-outer-space/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Plan 9 from Outer Space (Gremlin Ireland) - 1992" /><published>2024-12-22T20:33:08-05:00</published><updated>2024-12-23T06:46:01-05:00</updated><id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2024/12/22/plan-9-from-outer-space</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2024/12/22/plan-9-from-outer-space/"><![CDATA[<blockquote class="prompt-info">

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Outer_Space_(video_game)">Plan 9 from Outer Space</a> is a point and click adventure game adaptation of the film of the same name. It was developed at the Irish office of Gremlin Graphics for the Amiga and Atari ST, and was released in 1992. The game was published by Gremlin in Europe and by Konami in the United States. A DOS version was also developed, though only released in the US and Europe. Two editions of the game were made available at retail; the more common version was packaged with a VHS copy of the film, while a rarer version contained only the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/070.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The movie; Plan 9…..the critics hated it. But, the producer of the film has noticed that it’s been stolen by Bela Lugosi’s double. Find him. Track him. For God’s sake - just keep a straight head when you enter this part of the movie lot and town. Some of the most misguided people roam here! Most important…..get the film back!<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/039.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I’ve heard of the movie, and may even have seen it at some point in the past thirty years … but I don’t remember anything about it other than having a legacy of being a terrible movie. This doesn’t really set the stage for a good gaming experience, but here we go anyway.</p>

<p>Since my expectations were extremely low for this game to begin with, I figured I should play the Amiga version as my go-to emulator <a href="https://dirkwhoffmann.github.io/vAmiga/">vAmiga</a> has a handy-dandy fast-forward feature.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/038.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The <a href="https://retro-commodore.eu/files/downloads/amigamanuals-xiik.net/Games/Plan%209%20From%20Outer%20Space%20-%20Manual-DE-ENG-FR.pdf">game manual</a> doesn’t really set the stage for the game, and you’re sort of just dropped into a Movie Producer’s office who tells you you need to get the film back … and off you go.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/041.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There’s some basic copy protection to kick things off, but I opted for a cracked copy of the game to bypass this. The fine crackers at <a href="https://demozoo.org/groups/2904/">TKK</a> (only active for a brief period in ‘92 is seems) don’t seem to have included a cracktro, though it seems there are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q4rbvd2of4">examples of their work</a> if you’re curious.</p>

<p>The game’s interface is reminiscent of the MacVenture games, though in this case the vast majority of the screen is unused (just a static background). You have a small game window, and inventory list to the right of this and your verb list at the bottom right.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/043.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you explore or interact with the world and characters, a summary of these interactions fills the bottom left of the screen. Text sort of just rolls off though and there’s no scroll back so it’s easy to miss details if you’re not paying attention.</p>

<p>I found it a little hard to read the white text on the blue background, and the fact that each new interaction was indented just looked odd, but those are minor annoyances.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/047.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The graphics aren’t bad, but they’re nothing to write home about. Almost every male character uses the same model so they kind of blend together, and no one has anything interesting to say. Since I wasn’t sure what to do other than visit each screen, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EXAMINE</code> everything and move on it sort of felt like work to plod along this “adventure”.</p>

<p>You’re supposed to find a handful of movie reels spread across various cities, and typically you’ll need to complete some form of fetch quest to gain access to the place where the reel is.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/048.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are multiple locations you’ll need to explore, and these aren’t accessible until you discover them - either by examining something (like a pamphlet for the mall) or by talking to a character (the woman at the bar tells you where Bela Lugosi’s house is).</p>

<p>At each location there may be an opportunity to pick items up for later use, but inventory management is a pretty big gameplay mechanic. You only have limited “weight” you can carry - so you’ll frequently need to drop items in order to pick up new items.</p>

<p>Thankfully when you drop items some little creature picks it up and takes it back to the original location you found it. This makes it easy to backtrack and reacquire items you had to leave behind.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/053.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you find the film reels, you can take them to projection booths scattered throughout the game. Each booth has the same attendant working there that you can give a reel to and he’ll play it for you. I’m assuming these are clips from the original movie - which you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsb74pW7goU">watch on YouTube</a> if you’re curious 👀.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/061.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Talking to various characters you meet progresses the “plot”, but you need to be careful which dialogue options you pick as you can softlock the game by choosing the wrong option. For example, you need to ask this woman about the weather so that you can offer her beads and learn about a hippy camp.</p>

<p>If you hit on her first, there doesn’t appear to be a way to reset the conversation and you’re sort of stuck.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/065.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though infrequent, certain scenarios can result in a game over. I was playing this game in fast-forward for the majority of my time with the game as I had to start from scratch a couple times (due to softlocks), and because fast-forward mutes the music.</p>

<p>There’s one track that loops for the duration of the game, and there are very few sound effects. When there ARE sound effects, they tend to be extremely annoying (shrill and loud) - like the sounds in the cab or the bats in the cave.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/069.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The first half of the game all takes place in the multiple locations you travel to by cab around the studio. The second half of the game has you flying between Washington, Australia, Rio and Hong Kong. These cities you fly to have a cab outside the airport that will take you to the one location per city you can visit.</p>

<p>These travel options just sort of add padding to the various fetch quests, but that’s about it.</p>

<p>Eventually you’ll be hired by the CIA to go to Cuba to do … something. While you’re there, if you happened to bring the dictionary with you you can get the Cuban guard to give you some cigars and a poster that proves … something.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/076.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You’ll ultimately have to also go find some film for a guy in Hong Kong, which after you bring it back he gives you a talisman that you give to some monks - who then lead you to the aliens or something.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/plan9/077.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I just didn’t get it. I should probably watch the film, but this game is unlikely to add anything to that experience. Maybe if you’re a fan of the original film there’s an enjoyable experience to be had here, but I’m going to go out on a limb and say that for fans of the film - the game probably still sucks.</p>

<p>Though I would not recommend this game to anyone, it’s oddly satisfying knowing that the “worst movie ever made” also sort of translates to one of the worst gaming experiences on my list.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Quest_III">King’s Quest III: To Heir Is Human</a> is the third installment in the King’s Quest series of graphic adventure games developed and released by Sierra On-Line in 1986. The game was originally released for the Apple II and MS-DOS, and later ported to several other computer systems. It was the first title game in the series not to feature King Graham as the player character.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00018.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>King Graham and Queen Valanice had two children, Alexander and Rosella, and the kingdom was once peaceful. It wasn’t long until Alexander was snatched from his crib and things started to take a turn for the worse. A three-headed dragon threatens the ever-peaceful Daventry, and requires a maiden to be sacrificed every year. Rosella is the chosen one.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in a secluded house atop a mountain in the land of Llewdor, the evil wizard called Manannan keeps a young lad named Gwydion as his slave, forcing him to do menial tasks as he prepares his spells and observes the country through his telescope. Gwydion must find a way to outsmart the wizard, escape, and eventually discover the truth about his own identity.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I’m pretty sure I was about 8 years old when I first got a copy of King’s Quest III for our 386. Since a friend of mine made me a copy of the game and I didn’t have the <a href="https://mocagh.org/sierra/kq3brcc-manual.pdf">manual</a>, I printed off a copy someone had typed up and uploaded to a local BBS.</p>

<p>For me, King’s Quest III brings back memories of learning how to touch type. These old AGI games that I played as I was learning how to work with computers sort of forced me to become a better typist because hunting and pecking for letters while there’s a timer running meant I used to die a lot.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00006.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You start off in a wizard’s house on top of a hill. He’ll give you a task that you need to complete, and you’ve only got a certain amount of time to complete it in before he gets mad at you and zaps you.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure you have about 5 minutes of in-game time to do the initial task, which is actually plenty of time given how small the house is. This gives you a chance to explore a bit, interact with the world and start collecting some items.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00003.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you’ve read the manual, you know there are a number of spells you’ll need to prepare - and these are prepared using various items you collect throughout the game. As a result, you’ll find yourself picking up pretty much everything that isn’t nailed down on ever screen you visit.</p>

<p>The problem though is that when the wizard comes back to check on you, if you have any magical items in your inventory he’ll assume you’re up to no good and kill you on the spot.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00019.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When you bring up your inventory you’ll notice that some items have an asterisk at the end of their entries. This is how you differentiate magical items from normal items. If you pick up any of these items while the wizard is out, you’ll need to stash them under your bed before he gets back.</p>

<p>I honestly can’t remember if I figured this out through trial and error, if someone told me about it or if I read it in a walkthrough, but it wasn’t obvious to me that this was what you needed to do. As a result, though I have fond memories of this game - I also remember it being extremely frustrating and annoying to play.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00007.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When you finish your first task for the wizard, he (eventually) will appear and tell you he’s going to go off on a journey. This ends up giving you about 30 minutes of in-game time to figure out what to do next.</p>

<p>Since this wizard is a pain in your ass, you might as well try to get him out of your way first. Based on the spells you have recipes for, it seems like turning him into a cat might be your ticket to freedom.</p>

<p>This spell only requires a couple ingredients (mandrake root powder, ball of cat hair, fish oil, magic wand), and you’re able to find 75% of these in the wizard’s house. Since the fish oil isn’t here, you venture down the mountain to explore the world.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00008.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The mountain path is a pain in the ass, but given this is a Sierra game released in the late 80s you sort of expect every step to potentially lead to a game over. This was just how these games were designed, and if you’d played any other titles released around that time - you knew this was coming.</p>

<p>Unless you’re playing with a walkthrough it’s unlikely you’d be able to collect everything from in and around town in your first outing, so you’ll need to make the trek back up the mountain to the wizard’s house a few times - trying not to fall off the cliff each time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00015.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you can fall off of anything (not just the cliff), expect a game over. This game will give you many opportunities to shoot yourself in the foot, and you’ll likely muddle your way into those scenarios more often than not, so save early (and often).</p>

<p>Finding the fish oil is easy enough as it’s sold at the store in town, but you don’t have any money. You’ll need to steal gold from some bandits to buy this, but first you need to find their hideout - then get in without being caught. Once you figure all this out though you can return to the wizard’s house to whip up your first spell.</p>

<p>One item you’ll find early on is the magic map, which allows you to quick travel to any location you’ve previously visited. This is extremely convenient for warping from the wizard’s house down the mountain, but it doesn’t work to get you back to the house. As a result, plan to (safely) climb back up the mountain multiple times.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00024.png" alt="" />
<em>Typing these out whisks me back to the first dozen times I played this and didn’t know what “soporific” meant</em></p>

<p>With spell ingredients in hand, you find the wizard’s lair in the basement of the house, and flip to a specific page in the spell book to start preparing a spell. Having to laboriously type out the spells exactly as the manual describes is a good form of copy protection, but after the first couple spells it does become tedious.</p>

<p>You’ll need to prepare multiple spells, so you’ll be back in the basement a few times throughout the first half of the game as you get everything ready to eventually leave the island.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00020.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Any tiny mistake you make during spell preparation is a game over - but at least it’s kind of funny. Gwydion will transform himself partially as a result of the failed spell, and the results are specific to the spell you were trying to prepare (my favourite is him turning half into a fly).</p>

<p>If you’re able to get the first spell completed, you’ll end up with a magic cookie that when eaten will turn the consumer into a cat. If you try to give this to Manannan, it’s a magic item so he’ll just kill you. You need to hide the cookie in something else and give that to him, but if you didn’t get the porridge from the 3 bears house - you’re out of luck.</p>

<p>Without the right items, you’ll have to give Manannan something else to eat from the kitchen, then wait for him to leave again and go get the porridge and wait for him to come back again. Once you feed him the magic porridge, he turns into a cat and you have free reign of the world to finish collecting magical items, mixing spells and figuring out what to do next.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00026.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you find the oracle she’ll tell you you have a sister that’s a princess, that you’re a prince and you have to go save her. You’ll find some pirates in the bar and pay them to get access to their ship.</p>

<p>They sort of kidnap you at this point, and you have to wait (and wait and wait and wait) for 15-20 minutes for the ship to progress far enough that the game will allow you to progress.</p>

<p>The timer is not a welcome element to this game, so I’m glad it doesn’t make an appearance in any subsequent titles in the series.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00034.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you get off the pirate ship (using one of your spells and the magic map), you’ll end up in Daventry and it’s a short jaunt up to the dragon that is holding your sister captive. There’s some minor platforming here (climbing the cliff and navigating caves), but you eventually get there, cast a couple spells and escort your sister back to the castle.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00036.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though I have fond memories of this game, it’s not really much fun. The whole experience sort of feels like work and there isn’t really much to do once you reach the pirate ship but wait. If you use the map too early, you’ll drown … so you have to wait. Waiting is too common a theme in this game.</p>

<p>KQ3 does give you some quality of life improvements over the previous 2 entries in the series, but it’s not really adding much to the overall gaming experience. Most game screens don’t have any background music, so you play in silence for the majority of the game.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the game involves fetching ingredients for spells, so once you’ve completed that all you really have to do is get to the dragon. Trying to get past the snow monster is a little frustrating, but that’s the only real challenge once you get off the ship.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq3/scummvm-kq3-00028.png" alt="" />
<em>Yup, you’ve still got some waiting to do</em></p>

<p>I do like this game, but it’s a bit tedious to play nowadays. There were however remakes (yes - plural) by <a href="https://infamousadventures.itch.io/kings-quest-iii-vga-remake">Infamous Adventures</a> and <a href="https://www.agdinteractive.com/games/kq3/about/overview.html">AGD Interactive</a> that drop the text parser in favour of a more traditional P&amp;C interface.</p>

<p>I couldn’t get KQ3 Redux working on my Macbook (the game was released in 2011), but the Infamous Adventures release works perfectly. I would recommend trying one of these remakes if you want to experience the game today.</p>

<p>There have been several video games based on the 1991 film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(video_game)">Hook</a>. A side-scrolling platform game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Game Boy was released in the United States in February 1992. Subsequent side-scrolling platform games were released for the Commodore 64 and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), and an arcade beat ‘em up by Irem later in 1992, followed by versions for the Sega CD, Sega Genesis, and Sega’s handheld Game Gear console in 1993.</p>

<p>A graphic adventure point-and-click game, developed and published by Ocean Software, was released for Amiga, Atari ST, and DOS in 1992 - which is what this review focuses on.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/016.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Peter Banning is an ordinary suburban dad with two kids - or so everyone thinks. What not even his family know is his past as Peter Pan, scourge of Captain Hook in JM Barrie’s children’s fiction. Captain Hook gains revenge on Banning by stealing his two children, so Peter must return to Neverland, return to eternal childhood, and get them back.</p>

<p>It’s a point and click adventure, and the pirate setting ensures that it recalls the Monkey Island games. The top 2/3 of the screen features a visual depiction of the area Peter is in, which a row of icons along the bottom can be selected to alter the function of a mouse click. These include looking at an object, picking it up, talking to people, using objects to solve problems (often in combination with others), and giving objects to others.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/014.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Like most good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_Disk_File">Amiga disk file</a> based games you can find on the internet, this one was cracked by one of the notable cracking groups of the time - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairlight_(group)">Fairlight</a>. Though I don’t condone piracy (and a number of FLT members got caught during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Fastlink">Operation Fastlink</a> a decade later), for these 30+ year old games you need hardware emulators to play … I’m willing to “bend” the rules a bit …</p>

<p>I know of touched on this in previous reviews, but for those of us revisiting some of these ripped/cracked copies of games after 30+ years there is definitely a sense of nostalgia when you see a familiar cracktro.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/040.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>With the rise of services like GOG and Steam, quick and convenient access to digital copies of games is no longer an issue, so these demo scenes inserted into cracked binaries are now just an artifact of the past.</p>

<p>There’s a great collection of Fairlight’s demos at <a href="https://demozoo.org/groups/239/">DEMOZOO</a> for anyone that may be interested.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/022.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Since this game is based on the 1991 Steven Spielberg movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(film)">“Hook”</a>, I assumed the plot would sort of follow the film’s (which I believe it does, but I haven’t seen the movie in a very long time). You play as Peter, your kids have been kidnapped and you need to get them back. You’re secretly Peter Pan, but since you grew up you’ve lost the sense of wonder and magic that would allow you to fly - and this is what you’ll need to get your kids back.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/015a.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game starts off with a brief cinematic sequence which sets up the main story. Hook has your kids, and to get them back you’ll need to make your way back to Neverland - which Tinkerbell fills you in on, wraps you in a blanket and carries you off.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/018.png" alt="" />
<em>A bloody hacksaw and a bucket of blood? I don’t trust this dentist …</em></p>

<p>Once you land in the pirate town, you’re sort of on your own. There’s no indication what you’ll need to do or where to go, so you sort of just start wandering around. What I found frustrating almost immediately is that you can’t move your cursor around and surface hotspots; not you need to select the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code> action, then click on things randomly.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/021.png" alt="" />
<em>This gets annoying really quickly</em></p>

<p>If there’s something to look at, it’ll tell you - otherwise you get a generic message. This is frustrating because the game de-selects the magnifying glass icon after you use it, so you have to click it again and click back on the screen as you go pixel-hunting. If you <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TALK</code> to Tinkerbell, she’ll occasionally give you hints as to what you can do next, so that’s helpful.</p>

<p>Thankfully this game only has a couple dozen areas you can visit, so there’s really not all that many locations you’ll have to do this at. Most of the time it’s fairly obvious that there’s an item you can pick up or interact with … but not always.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/027.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To advance the story you’ll have to interact with the various NPCs scattered about the game. There’s a very basic conversation system that involves right clicking to select what you want to ask, then left clicking to ask what you’ve selected. Typically there are only 3-4 options to choose from, with one being a hint as to what the fetch quest you’ll need to perform for that character will be.</p>

<p>For such a short game, there are a lot of items you’ll need to collect. It’s usually not too difficult to figure out which character needs what, but there are also unused items you’ll collect. This was frustrating as I found myself backtracking near the end game trying to use these items on various characters to see if I’d missed anything.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/023.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Your goals in this game are pretty simple. First, you need to find Captain Hook - but to do this you need to dress up as a pirate to get on his ship. Then, once you meet him, he challenges you to a duel, but you need to become Peter Pan again. To do that you need to get your memories back, which the Lost Boys can help you do.</p>

<p>That’s basically it. Getting the pieces of pirate clothing is surprisingly frustrating, as it’s really not obvious how many pieces you need, or once you have them how to put them on (this was walkthrough-checking territory for me).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/017.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For example, to get the pirate hat you’ll need to build grappling hook from an anchor and rope. When you get up to the location where you should use this, Peter tells you he’s not going to do this TWICE, before he actually throws it and swings. This is frustrating as the game really makes it appear as though you’re doing something wrong, so why would you KEEP TRYING?</p>

<p>Once you do swing to the other side of the town square, you actually need to time it properly to snag the hat of the pirate walking back and forth. This ALSO isn’t obvious, and you’ll miss 99% of the time. Peter doesn’t indicate he was trying to grab something and missed, so it’s easy to just swing over and back without realizing you’re supposed to grab a hat at all.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/030.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The story will progress through the Neverwood and into the Lost Boys hideout, where you need to get your memories back so you can remember a happy memory that will allow you to fly. Tinkerbell helps you get there, but first there are a whole bunch of item combination puzzles and fetch quests you’ll need to complete.</p>

<p>Make sure you examine everything you pick up, because a few times the items aren’t useable, but they actually conceal another item you’ll need - such as the fishing net, which you only need a piece of string from to make a bow.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/034.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you remember you’re Peter Pan, a cutscene will play out and you’ll fly back to Hook’s ship to challenge him to a duel. This plays out similar to Monkey Island’s <a href="https://monkeyisland.fandom.com/wiki/Insult_Sword_Fighting">insult sword fighting</a>, but with much lower stakes.</p>

<p>If you pick the right answer, you push Hook to the left (towards the plank), and if you pick incorrectly, he pushes you to the right. You can’t lose though, so if you pick wrong, just keep trying until you eventually make him walk the plank and win the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/038.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Hook is not bad, but it’s nothing special. The graphics are decent, and the sound effects and periodic background music enhance the experience sufficiently. Though there’s no points system in this game, when you solve various item combination puzzles you’ll see Captain Hook get REALLY angry in the lower left of your screen.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hook/039.png" alt="" />
<em>He’s big mad that I figured out how to build that bow</em></p>

<p>A lot of the story progression is based on you having prior knowledge of Peter Pan, so the game doesn’t really fill too much more in for you. The Lost Boys are sort of just there, and act as basic NPCs to nudge you along your journey, but don’t add any depth or value beyond that.</p>

<p><a href="https://advgamer.blogspot.com/search/label/Hook">The Adventurers Guild</a> did a great review of this game that I’d highly recommend. It’s also how I learned that the game’s designer <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/31699/kevin-oxland/">Kevin Oxland</a> has a book out on game design (called <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Gameplay-design-Kevin-Oxland/dp/0321204670">Gameplay and Design</a>) that I might just have to check out.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Quest_6">Space Quest 6: Roger Wilco in the Spinal Frontier</a> is a point-and-click adventure game developed and published by Sierra On-Line in 1995. It is the sixth and final game in the Space Quest series, though (spoiler) the game ends on a cliffhanger that will ultimately never be resolved.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq6/scummvm-sq6-00005.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Roger Wilco, the brave interstellar janitor who has already saved the universe from many great dangers, is now in a very embarrassing position. His commanders show no respect for his courageous actions in the previous game. Instead, he is being accused of all kinds of violations against the galactic law, is deprived of all the honors he got in the previous game, and as a token of mercy, is allowed to return to his old job - cleaning closets… But those unfortunate events are just the beginning of much bigger troubles Roger will get into. Once again, the future of galaxy depends on him!<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq6/scummvm-sq6-00022.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This final entry in the series runs on the later SCI32 engine Rev 2.100.002 (aka <a href="http://sciwiki.sierrahelp.com/index.php/Sierra_SCI_Release_List#SCI2.1_.28middle.29">SCI2.1 (middle)</a>), which allowed it to use SVGA graphics with 256 colors at 640×480 resolution. Unlike other SCI games, it did not have the interface in a pull down bar at the top of the screen, but instead used a “verb bar” window along the bottom of the screen, similar to LucasArts’ SCUMM engine. The graphics style was also more cartoonish than in previous games, as well as incorporating an ample amount of 3-D rendered images.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq6/scummvm-sq6-00021.png" alt="" />
<em>I don’t love the visual style of the human characters…</em></p>

<p>I appreciated the updated visual style of the backgrounds and the UI, but honestly the closeup shots of any humanoid character just looked … off. Though there was clearly a lot of work put into the character design, I miss the pixel art of <a href="/blog/2024/09/10/space-quest-v/">Space Quest V</a>.</p>

<p>An increased colour palette and next-gen SCI game engine sort of left everything looking “flat” in my opinion.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq6/scummvm-sq6-00020.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The cutscenes have not aged well, and are reminiscent of basically all 3-D rendered scenes of the early to mid 90s. I can’t really fault Sierra for this as this is just an artifact of the games of that era.</p>

<p>Most cutscenes felt more like filler than substance, and were just there to eat up some time. They could occasionally become repetitive and tedious if they were triggered every time you needed to backtrack (like with the “riding the tapeworm” sequence near the end).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq6/scummvm00054.2.bmp" alt="" />
<em>Roger is really trying to push both buttons at once - and is - but it doesn’t look like it in ScummVM</em></p>

<p>While playing through the game I thought I hit some weird visual bug, but apparently it’s well known and only present in ScummVM (<a href="https://bugs.scummvm.org/ticket/9749">#9749 - SCI: SQ6: Shuttle Bay Entrance bug</a>). ScummVM’s developers have included many, many improvements to SCI engine games (including <a href="https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/blob/master/engines/sci/engine/script_patches.cpp#L25289-L25318">script patches for SQ6</a>), however apparently the issue here is a little different.</p>

<p>Sierra actually <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5287446A">patented</a> their <a href="http://sciwiki.sierrahelp.com/index.php/ToDo/Pathfinding/Patent">pathfinding algorithm</a>, so the ScummVM engineers had to do their own version of it instead. This can result in some visual anomalies like in the screenshot above.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq6/scummvm-sq6-00008.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As with most Sierra adventure games, you run around picking stuff up in hopes of using it later to solve some puzzle. The inventory puzzles in this game weren’t all that challenging, and it was actually pretty clever how the fish kept ending up in your possession as you progressed.</p>

<p>I assumed this was being set up as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring">“red herring”</a> gag, but this fish would actually end up being the solution to the final puzzle in the game (spoiler), so several times when you were about to leave an area permanently, a character threw it to you so you’d have it again.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq6/scummvm-sq6-00012.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Overall, the voice acting is not great. I couldn’t bring myself to disable speech altogether though because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Owens">Gary Owens</a> as the narrator just crushes it. If it weren’t for his dry, sarcastic delivery throughout the game I’d likely knock several more points off the <em>Sound</em> score.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq6/scummvm-sq6-00024.png" alt="" />
<em>By far, this is my favourite scene in the game</em></p>

<p>Whereas the previous game was a parody of Star Trek, Space Quest 6 is a mishmash of various science fiction properties that were popular at the time the game came out. Almost every name and location is a parody or pun - which if you’re in on the joke adds to the experience. I’m not sure how accessible the writing of the game is to a modern audience as a result.</p>

<p>The overarching plot involves Roger initially being targeted for “Project Immortality”, but instead his colleague Stellar Santiago is taken (after she saves Roger’s life). He then needs to rescue her by first finding her, then being shrunk down to enter her digestive system and destroy some nanobots.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq6/scummvm-sq6-00029.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I really didn’t find the story to be all that interesting and it was mostly forgettable. The puzzles aren’t overly difficult, and typically just involve fetch quests and backtracking. The game’s locations aren’t that expansive, so searching everywhere doesn’t take all that long, and though there’s a bit of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pixel_hunting">pixel-hunting</a> on certain screens, key items are typically out in the open.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq6/scummvm-sq6-00017.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I didn’t find nearly as many interesting ways to die as I would have in previous games, and the message you’re prompted with is fairly generic. This was part of the fun of the Space Quest series, and I found after about an hour of playing the game I didn’t bother messing around to see how I might die as it just wasn’t proving to be all that entertaining.</p>

<p>For new gamers it’s appreciated that you get a “Try Again” option, which just rewinds back to right before you made a mistake and doesn’t force you to rely on an earlier save. It’s fairly obvious most of the time though what the “right” choice is, so you likely won’t die too often.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq6/scummvm-sq6-00033.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Space Quest 6 ends on a cliffhanger, but since there was never a sequel made this is effectively where the series concludes. The game doesn’t have the same feel as the previous 5 entries in the series, and this is likely due to it not actually being made by the “Two Guys from Andromeda”, but instead <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Mandel_(video_game_designer)">Josh Mandel</a>.</p>

<p>Mandel designed the game, but left near the end of production and Scott Murphy (on of the “Two Guys”) came in to finish it off. This is likely why some of the gameplay feels uneven, which is confirmed in a 2006 interview with Josh Mandel:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“One of the inventory items cut was a comic book CD in Nigel’s room that was fully readable and had all the hints to the Datacorder puzzle. From a writing and design standpoint, it was fully finished, and I know that Barry Smith had started the artwork. I don’t understand why it was cut. But the comic book content was something I’d worked on for months, and it was something that I was uncharacteristically proud of … I think it would’ve been one of the greatest parody sequences in the SQ series. So not only was I very upset not to see it in the game, but the fact that they had to put the Datacorder hints in the manual, leading player to think it was meant to be copy protection, disturbed me greatly.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq6/scummvm-sq6-00011.png" alt="" />
<em>I guess this wasn’t meant to be copy protection</em></p>

<p>The Datacorder puzzle did feel like copy protection, so I feel Josh’s frustration and am genuinely curious as to what the comic book CD experience would have been like. I guess we’ll never know, just like we’ll never know what Stellar Santiago meant when she said we were “going to like the next mission” …</p>

<p>Space Quest 6 isn’t great, but it’s good enough to play through at least once. If you’re only going to play one game in the series though, I’d recommend either <a href="/blog/2024/02/16/space-quest-iii/">Space Quest III</a> or <a href="/blog/2024/09/10/space-quest-v/">Space Quest V</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_a_Killing_Moon">Under a Killing Moon</a> is a 1994 point-and-click adventure interactive movie video game. It is the third installment in the Tex Murphy series of adventure games produced by Access Software.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_050.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It is December of the year 2042. The world is still recovering from the disastrous consequences of the World War III. Radioactivity has turned many humans into mutants, and the gap between those and the “norms” (non-affected humans) is growing wider. Certain places in the world have retained the feel and the charm of the old times - among those is the Old San Francisco. There, the private investigator Tex Murphy is trying to deal with unemployment, upcoming poverty, and his melancholic mood following his divorce. After solving a simple robbery case, Tex attracts the attention of a mysterious woman who calls herself Countess Renier, and is hired by her to find a missing statuette. Things gradually begin to go wrong in this investigation, and Tex finds himself involved in a confrontation with a powerful and dangerous secret cult.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_004.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Under a Killing Moon</em> is the sequel to Access Software’s previous title <em>Martian Memorandum</em>. Though I haven’t played through this one yet, I have previously covered <a href="/blog/2023/01/19/mean-streets/">Mean Streets</a> and <a href="/blog/2023/04/20/countdown/">Countdown</a> - the first being a Tex Murphy adventure.</p>

<p>I’m a fan of old detective movies and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir">film noir</a> genre in general, so the introductory cut scene really hooked me right away and drew me into the dystopian future that was this game’s world.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_006.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Right from the beginning you feel like you’re in a movie, which if you’ve watched the documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tooF40ktbdM">“The Making of Tex Murphy”</a> reinforces this further as the game developers really wanted to make movies.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/07/under-a-killing-moon/">The Digital Antiquarian’s <em>Under a Killing Moon</em></a> article, Tex Murphy first appeared in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_10_from_Outer_Space">Plan 10 from Outer Space</a> before eventually being repurposed as the protagonist in various Access Software titles:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Vandegrift had recently returned to Bountiful to take a job as Access’s art director, and was more than up for Jones’s plan. The two had dreams of showing at Sundance as they wrote a script that combined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maltese_Falcon_(1941_film)">The Maltese Falcon</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a>. Jones took the starring role of a private detective born in the wrong time, who channeled not only Humphrey Bogart but also Roy Rogers, what with his penchant for yodeling cowboy tunes. The detective-cum-cowboy’s name was Tex Murphy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_000.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Before diving into <em>Under a Killing Moon</em>, you first need to install and configure it. There’s something really nostalgic about the design of these DOS era configuration screens that try to make it as easy as possible to configure your sound card.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure I never had more than one device ever (at a time) so my digital sound and music devices were always the same, but in this modern age of emulation, might as well splurge and setup a faux-MT 32 for all the music this game has to offer.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_029.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You play as Tex Murphy, who’s a down on his luck private investigator looking for his next job. The game opens with a cinematic cutscene, then drops you into Tex’s office, which you can fully explore in 3D.</p>

<p>The game comes with 2 navigation modes - interactive and exploration. When you’re in exploration mode, you can move around the environment as if you’re playing DOOM. Tex can look all around using the mouse to control your field of vision, but you can also “stand” and “crouch” to see above and below things.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_048.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>A pretty big part of the game’s puzzle design revolves around this mechanic of panning and tilting the camera to see over and into things. If there’s ever a trash can in a room, it’s worth having a look into as there’s usually something in there you’ll need to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_049.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>What you’ll often find in these trash cans are pieces of notes you’ll need to reassemble. This can be extremely time consuming to complete, but the game does at least give you instructions each time that lets you know what the goal of the puzzle is, and how to manipulate the pieces.</p>

<p>Each note reassembly puzzle is slightly different, so I appreciate that it didn’t just feel like busy work, but it’s obvious the designers were proud of this mechanic and wanted to reuse it as often as possible.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_035.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There’s more to collect in this game than just ripped up notes you need to put back together, and these are all stored in your inventory. Each item can be either examined, used or combined - and it’s worth trying all 3 of these options with literally everything you pick up.</p>

<p>Examining items is a requirement as many times the item you initially picked up isn’t actually the thing you want. Examining it shows a 3D view of the item as it’s rotated, and you may discover a compartment with a key, or you’ll open it up and take something out - discarding the initial item in the process.</p>

<p>Though there are several item combination puzzles, the end result is typically pretty obvious, so the various items you need to collect and combine to form the final item are also pretty obvious.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_056.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To navigate around the world of <em>Under a Killing Moon</em>, you have access to a quick travel map. New locations are added based on conversations with characters or by examining certain inventory items.</p>

<p>Many locations aren’t actually “explorable”, but simply contain a single character you can talk to. This can make the game world look a lot bigger than it is.</p>

<p>Since it’s REALLY easy to miss picking up key items in this game, the map is actually extremely useful. For locations (like Chandler Ave.) where there are several places you can visit, you can actually go directly to a key location right away by selecting it from the map.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_030.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The story progresses through interactions with a couple dozen characters you’ll meet throughout your adventure. Instead of the typical dialogue tree adventure games present you with, <em>Under a Killing Moon</em> relies on a 3 options system used to set the tone of the question you want to ask.</p>

<p>Typically the option you select won’t matter, and the conversation will proceed “on rails”, but if you’re not careful with certain people you’ll miss key details if you pick the wrong options - or even get yourself killed!</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_031.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Dying in this game brings you back to the big detective in the sky, who will let you know it’s not your time yet and give you another chance.</p>

<p>You may also get a clue as to how you should have proceeded. Since this section is voiced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Earl_Jones">James Earl Jones</a>, it’s at least a bit enjoyable hearing him reassure you that it’s not your time and you should get back out there and try again.</p>

<p>Hopefully you remembered to save your game recently, as restore a previous save is the only option here - other than restarting from the beginning.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_059.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though saving early and often is pretty standard fare for an adventure game, it’s worth calling out <em>Under a Killing Moon</em>’s storage system.</p>

<p>When you start the game, you create a player, which is what you’ll be storing your games under. You can have multiple players with their own series of saves, which I guess if you’re sharing your computer with a sibling would be useful to keep your save games separated.</p>

<p>Each save automatically captures the current location, and you can even enter arbitrary notes about the save, which can also be handy.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_055.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The story unfolds over 7 days, with each day starting with a title card. Once you solve the case of the robbery from the pawn shop and realize you may want to get back into sleuthing, you’ll need to get your fax machine fixed so you can maybe get some new cases.</p>

<p>One of the locations you gain access to early on is an electronics store, which seems to always have exactly one item for sale - and that item always ends up being the thing you currently need (how convenient).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_008.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To get into the electronics store though, you’ll need some means to buy things - like a credit card. In your office you’ll find a stack of mail by the front door, which includes an application for a credit card.</p>

<p>Opening the drawers in your office will reveal a pen and an envelope, and combining those three items will create a “ready-to-mail application”, which you then just need to drop into a mailbox.</p>

<p>This is how a lot of these item combination puzzles work. There aren’t really all that many items on any day that you have access to, and it’s fairly obvious how they need to be used.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_043.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Whenever you go to the electronics shop, if there’s an item for sale, you’re going to need it - and it’s only a credit card swipe away. I’m pretty sure there’s no limit on the card, but you only need to use it a handful of times in this one store in the game where you have the power to buy anything.</p>

<p>Navigating the dialogue options properly with the electronics store owner is required on one of the later days, as you’ll need him to spill some info about the security system he just installed at the Knickerbocker hotel.</p>

<p>If you don’t pick the right options, he’ll end the conversation early. Since there are only 3 options available for each conversation you have, it’s worth testing all variations with all characters just in case.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_028.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>During conversations with characters, you can also ask about various keywords. Not all characters will know about a all keywords, but this is how you advance your investigation.</p>

<p>You’ll also learn new keywords as you progress, and will need to backtrack to ask all characters about these to see if they can shed any light on the topic.</p>

<p><em>Under a Killing Moon</em> does a great job of making this game world feel large and expansive, but there actually aren’t that many locations to visit or characters to interact with.</p>

<p>The balance they strike though of forcing you to backtrack without making it feel tedious is impressive.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_022.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Some characters you interact with are mutants, and may be disfigured. I know that earlier games go into more detail about what happened in the world for this to happen, but here they don’t really explore this very much.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://texmurphy.fandom.com/wiki/Under_a_Killing_Moon">some additional context</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some people have developed a natural resistance against radioactivity, and thus are normal or “Norms” – everybody else are Mutants in some form. Tensions between the two groups have risen dramatically since the end of the war, and Norms and Mutants usually do not get along. […] The Law and Order Party has long since dissolved and disbanded but it still lives on in the more extremist and openly anti - mutant group The Crusade for Genetic Purity which now espouses a return to pre-WWIII society with Norms having full control of society without mutants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can ask characters about the crusade, but most won’t really give you much information.</p>

<p>I actually really love the backstory of this game and wish they’d leaned into world building a bit more, but I guess the expectation was you’d played through the previous games in the the series and were up to speed already.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_052.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As the game progresses you get wrapped up in a plot to eradicate all mutants (and I think humans considered “impure”) by raining down a virus from an orbiting space station known as the Moon Child.</p>

<p>Your mission then becomes to save Eva (who you learn infiltrated the CAPRICORN corporation’s cult and was sharing info via videos) from the Moon Child, blow up the station and return to Earth.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/moon/tex3_066.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For a game considered the “largest video game ever” (at 4 CDs), <em>Under a Killing Moon</em> is fairly straightforward to complete.</p>

<p>This being an FMV game from the early 90s means you’re going to be treated to some questionable voice and character acting, but overall it’s not too bad.</p>

<p>James Earl Jones’ narrative does a great job of setting the tone of the game, and the brief sequences with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margot_Kidder">Margot Kidder</a> are enjoyable.</p>

<p>Navigating the game world’s 3D environment from a first person perspective made the exploration portions of the game very engaging, and since most scenes weren’t that big it didn’t feel like things were purposely hidden in weird places just to screw with you.</p>

<p>You really feel like you’re part of the story as it progresses, and the characters (typically) don’t feel two dimensional. The puzzles aren’t overly complicated, and though they can be a bit repetitive, don’t become tedious.</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun playing through <em>Under a Killing Moon</em>, and look forward to one day revisiting this world and its characters in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pandora_Directive">The Pandora Directive</a>, but given the rate at which I play through these games … that might take me a while.</p>
