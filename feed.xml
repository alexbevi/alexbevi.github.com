The colours were vibrant, there was intro music and sound effects throughout the game, the story felt immersive, and oh shit, you died, time to reload …. assuming you remembered to save. Unlike Mystery House where you’re sorta just dropped into the world and have to figure out... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Mystery House</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/08/03/mystery-house/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mystery House" /><published>2021-08-03T07:25:36-04:00</published> <updated>2021-08-06T07:02:50-04:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/08/03/mystery-house/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/08/03/mystery-house/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="Let's Adventure!" /> <summary> This review is part of the “Let’s Adventure!” series Mystery House is an adventure game released by On-Line Systems in 1980.

I’ve always found myself going back to this genre, and as I grew up and moved into software development the ScummVM project held a certain appeal as it combined two passions for me. Though I was never very active in the project, I tried to contribute in various ways over the years, finally seeing some success re... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Generating a ScummVM Games List</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/05/31/generating-a-scummvm-games-list/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Generating a ScummVM Games List" /><published>2021-05-31T06:55:45-04:00</published> <updated>2021-08-04T06:47:52-04:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/05/31/generating-a-scummvm-games-list/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/05/31/generating-a-scummvm-games-list/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="Programming" /> <summary> 2021-06-01: Note that you can actually generate the games list directly from the scummvm binary by running scummvm --list-all-games. Oops … A long time ago I reached out to the ScummVM leadership about a script I’d been working on that could be used to scrape detection entries and generate a definitive games list.
