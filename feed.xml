Strangely enough what I remember most about it was the oversized box I couldn’t bring myself to get rid of, but couldn’t seem to find a place to put either. EarthBound takes place in the 1990s, several years after the events of Mother, in the fictional count... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>MongoDB ORMs, ODMs, and Libraries</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/11/02/mongodb-orms-odms-and-libraries/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="MongoDB ORMs, ODMs, and Libraries" /><published>2022-11-02T06:28:40-04:00</published> <updated>2022-12-14T14:58:49-05:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/11/02/mongodb-orms-odms-and-libraries/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/11/02/mongodb-orms-odms-and-libraries/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="MongoDB" /> <summary> Cross posted from MongoDB Developer Center Though developers have always been capable of manually writing complex queries to interact with a database, this approach can be tedious and error-prone. Object-Relational Mappers (or ORMs) improve the developer experience, as they accomplish multiple meaningful tasks: Facilitating interactions between the database and an application by abstract... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>From Engineering to Product Management</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/10/06/from-engineering-to-product-management/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="From Engineering to Product Management" /><published>2022-10-06T03:13:27-04:00</published> <updated>2022-10-06T04:47:53-04:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/10/06/from-engineering-to-product-management/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/10/06/from-engineering-to-product-management/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="Personal" /> <summary> I’ve spent my entire professional career as an engineering IC either churning out code, working on architectural challenges or helping to lead engineering teams (while still churning out code).
