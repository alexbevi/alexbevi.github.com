<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWeb">DreamWeb</a> is an MS-DOS and Amiga point-and-click cyberpunk top-down adventure game released in 1994, developed by Creative Reality and published by Empire Interactive Entertainment. The game features mature themes and a dark plot filled with violence and brief full frontal nudity; a rarity for games at the time.</p>

<p>You play as Ryan, a bartender in a futuristic city who’s been having weird dreams of an entity known as the Dreamweb. In the dream that opens the game, Ryan is asked by the master monk of the Keepers to be the deliverer and kill the seven evils, who are united to break the Dreamweb and send mankind spiraling into chaos.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dreamweb/scummvm-dreamweb-cd-00031.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>ScummVM announced support for DreamWeb in May of 2012, and though I tried it out at the time I honestly didn’t like the game. I’m pretty sure this was because I didn’t really do anything more than load it, try to move around, get thoroughly confused and quit. To appreciate this game you need to actually read the material that it’s distributed with (the <em>“Diary of a (Mad?) Man”</em> - which is available for free on the ScummVM site) as it helps setup the backstory.</p>

<p>The interface is also a very different as you only get about 33% of the screen dedicated to the game world. The rest is taken up by a top bar that gives you tools like save/load/inspect, and down the left hand side of the screen is a large view of Ryan. This actually acts as your inventory access as well as a zoom window so you can more closely inspect things on screen you may want to interact with.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dreamweb/scummvm-dreamweb-cd-00006.png" alt="" />
<em>Nothing like barging into the can to have a conversation while someone’s taking a shit</em></p>

<p>Each screen is static and doesn’t scroll, though as you move the mouse around you’ll find hotspots called out in the zoom window that you can interact with. If you can move in a certain direction this will be shown using arrows, and if there are characters on screen you can interact with, they’ll spill their line of dialogue along with a voice-acted version of the text.</p>

<p>There’s no branching dialogue trees in this game, which is kind of a nice change. Everyone has a fixed message they want to relay, and once they’ve done that you can either ask them to repeat it or move along.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dreamweb/scummvm-dreamweb-cd-00014.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can interact with almost every single element of the environment that has a label. When you do so, depending on what it is you’ve selected you may be presented with additional interaction options in the top right of the screen indicating actions you can take. This is sort of the verb menu you’d get in other adventure games, though I have to admit I found this more contextual approach a lot more intuitive.</p>

<p>This is how you can pick up items, combine items and talk to people.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dreamweb/scummvm-dreamweb-cd-00018.png" alt="" />
<em>I guess if you gotta go, go out with a “bang” …</em></p>

<p>As the monks have selected you to terminate the 7 evils, ultimately your goal is to hunt down these individuals and murder them. Killing the first target is sort of the hardest as it’s sort of like the “training mission” to get you acclimated to the game, controls, world and story. Figuring out how to get a gun is a bit challenging, and figuring out where the first target (David Crane) is takes some trial and error.</p>

<p>You basically just need to click on everything, inspect everything, talk to everyone and try using everything you’ve picked up on everything you come across. This is standard adventure game fare, but I found for some reason this game was a bit more confusing to “get the hang of” - possibly due to the interface feeling so different than typical Sierra Online or LucasArts style games.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dreamweb/scummvm-dreamweb-cd-00027.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Trying to figure out where to go next may seem challenging, but once you’ve given yourself a chance to get used to the controls and the flow of this game, it actually progresses in a very linear fashion. Ryan will call out new information in a very obvious way, and traveling to new locations is just a matter of going outside and selecting from the list of available locations.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dreamweb/scummvm-dreamweb-cd-00033.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>From the travel screen you can cycle through all available locations, as well as get information about each by clicking the note icon in the upper right hand side of the screen. As you move around the game world and inspect everything and talk to everyone, you’ll slowly learn various door codes and network logins and passwords. You’ll need these to be able to explore all key locations as well as progress the story.</p>

<p>Navigating the network unfortunately can be a bit confusing.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dreamweb/scummvm-dreamweb-cd-00021.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are only a couple of commands you actually need to use and these are documented in the manual under the <em>“The Network Monitor”</em> section. The manual sort of hints at you needing to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOGON RYAN</code> to get started, and that you’ll need a password. If you read the material that comes with the game, the last page of the diary has your network password.</p>

<p>You’ll find various cartridges scattered throughout the game, which you can put into these network monitors and explore. Some of them require you to use a different login to access the contents, which you’ll find by exploring.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dreamweb/scummvm-dreamweb-cd-00023.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Almost everything can be picked up and carried with you, but you have very limited inventory space. Fortunately if you need to drop anything it will remain visible on the screen in case you need to come back later and pick it back up.</p>

<p>This is actually an important mechanic in this game as more than once you’ll find yourself needing to pick things up and immediately drop them because something might be hidden underneath. Because your inventory is limited to 30 slots, you’ll want to make sure you carefully select what you do and don’t carry around with you.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dreamweb/scummvm-dreamweb-cd-00039.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Overall I genuinely enjoyed playing this game. It’s extremely dark and almost has a cyberpunk type of feel to it, especially once you finally finish the game only to realize your reward is being returned to your life to face the consequences of your actions. This results in a standoff with the police where they ultimately kill you, releasing your aura back to the Dreamweb for the cycle to being again.</p>

<p>The ambient music playing throughout enhances the “Blade Runner”-esque nature of the game, though you’re not chasing replicants here. I actually felt like DreamWeb would make a good addition to the cyberpunk genre along with titles like <a href="/blog/2016/02/23/just-finished-shadowrun/">Shadowrun</a> or <a href="/blog/2023/02/13/rise-of-the-dragon/">Rise of the Dragon</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dreamweb/scummvm-dreamweb-cd-00040.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In October 2012, the creators and copyright holders of DreamWeb, Creative Reality and Neil Dodwell, released the game as freeware for use with ScummVM. It is available for download from <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/games/#games-dreamweb:dreamweb">their Downloads page</a>. Unlike the version <a href="http://www.textfiles.com/piracy/RAZOR/dream.nfo">cracked by Razor1911</a>, the freeware version includes the copy protection (guessing the pattern at the alter near the endgame) as well as the network logon passwords.</p>

<p>Though extremely linear in nature, this game can be pretty challenging. You’ll likely need a walkthrough to get through the Network Monitor stuff unless you’re taking an extremely methodical and thorough approach to your playthrough.</p>

<p>DreamWeb wasn’t well received critically when it was released, but I think it’s actually a very good entry in the pantheon of adventure games - and not one to miss. If you’re a fan of more mature darker stories and are willing to do the work up front to read through the supporting material I think you’ll really enjoy this gaming experience.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Ventura:_The_CD-Rom_Game">Ace Ventura: The CD-Rom Game</a> is an adventure game released for the PC based on the animated series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Ventura:_Pet_Detective_(TV_series)">Ace Ventura: Pet Detective</a>.</p>

<p>The game is a classic point and click adventure game that resembles the tone of the Leisure Suit Larry series by Sierra Games, in that it approaches the adult style of humor featured, which is implied but never shown, all while remaining faithful to the family-friendly tone established in the corresponding animated series broadcasting at the time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ace/krnl386_025.png" alt="" />
<em>Windows 3.x technically ran on DOS … so why not DOSBox</em></p>

<p>Part of the fun (and challenge) of writing this series is getting some of these old games to work at all. I thought I was clever and could get this game working using a virtual machine but after trying with Windows 3.x, 95, 98 and eventually Windows 7 I kept running into issues with speed, sync and random crashes. I took some inspiration from what they’re doing at <a href="https://collectionchamber.blogspot.com/p/adventure.html">The Collection Chamber</a> and got this up and running using DOSBox by first installing Windows 3.11.</p>

<p>This worked like a charm, and by using <a href="https://dosbox-x.com/">DOSBox-X</a> I could even take advantage of CPU speed hacks and save states. The latter were less relevant as this game saves your progress anytime you exit the game - but still better safe than sorry.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ace/krnl386_003.png" alt="" />
<em>I dig the cartoony art style of this game. It’s likely true to the cartoon it’s based on</em></p>

<p>You play as Ace Ventura, the Pet Detective - but not the one from the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109040/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_6_nm_2_q_ace%2520ventura">movie of the same name</a>. This game is based off the animated series that I never knew existed. I guess this came out as I was aging out of Saturday morning cartoons, but it’s kind of interesting to know that one of the writers on that show was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_MacFarlane">Seth MacFarlane</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ace/krnl386_006.png" alt="" />
<em>So many stupid minigames</em></p>

<p>Though there’s a weak plot underlying this game, you’re basically just moving from one minigame to the next. For example, after you leave your apartment the first time, you end up underwater trying to get onto a sub through the garbage shute - which you have to swim up. While doing this you have to avoid garbage while collecting oxygen. Later you have to build a totem pole with random parts, then keep a whale centered on sonar, then jump from moving whale to moving whale … etc. None of these are particularly fun, but at least they’re typically short.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ace/krnl386_010.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Like most adventure games you have to randomly hunt for items to help you solve certain puzzles. There really isn’t all that much to collect in this game and the things you can interact with are pretty obvious. If you try to use the wrong items together or interact with anything but the <em>exact thing</em> Ace is supposed to focus on on any particular screen you just get a generic “Nope. Can’t do it” type of response, so finding the correct targets is easy.</p>

<p>One item combination puzzle is almost insanely nonsensical, though it makes a bit of sense in retrospect. When you get to your apartment the second time you find out the landlord has cut your power, so to use your computer you need to attach a cable from the tv to the fuse box, attach the other end to the tub, fill the tub with water, pick up some electric eels, pick up some rubber gloves, grab the eels with the gloves and drop them in the tub. Easy right???</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ace/krnl386_031.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Solving the product ordering puzzle was also a bit obtuse. I ended up leaning on the walkthrough for the majority of the endgame just because things weren’t making sense anymore. It’s not that they were hard - just - confusing. Maybe if I had a bit more patience I could have worked my though these naturally but honestly after a couple hours plugging away at these puzzles and mini games I was just getting frustrated and the story progression wasn’t keeping me engaged.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ace/krnl386_033.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Eventually you get to the castle in Bavaria - because that’s where Phatteus Lardass’ lair is. Yeah, you’re reading that right … I’m sure 16 year old me would be laughing his ass off at this, but it just gets an eye roll at this point. Anyway, a couple of simple puzzles and one overly complex pattern matching puzzle later and you get to the stage where Lardass is shooting you with a laser. Avoid this long enough and he “brings the house down” literally, and that’s the end of the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ace/krnl386_039.png" alt="" />
<em>Look at that - you saved the animals! I guess that was the goal of the game?</em></p>

<p>I used to love this type of comedy - and Ace Ventura specifically, so this game made me feel old. I guess the fact that I could remember how to install Windows 3.11 without needing to resort to instructions because I’d done it a few times over the years also made me feel old. Honestly, that part was more fun than this game, so thanks Ace Ventura for giving me that experience at least.</p>

<p>Overall experience here was pretty lackluster. There’s really nothing notable about the background music or sound effects, and though the art style is expectedly cartoonish, most ot the game is just static backgrounds. There’s very little to interact with and you’re kind of left to fill in the gaps in the story yourself. Maybe these are pulled from episodes of the TV show, and if I’d watched it the game might have made more sense.</p>

<p>If it weren’t in the list for this series there’s no reason I’d ever have played this game, and honestly wouldn’t recommend it to anyone else.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_on_the_Mississippi">Murder on the Mississippi</a> is a 1986 detective adventure game developed and published by Activision for the Commodore 64, Commodore 128 and the Apple II computers, where you assume the role of Sir Charles Foxworth and must solve a murder mystery on the luxury ship “Delta Princess”. The story is based loosely on the Agatha Christie novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_on_the_Nile">Death on the Nile</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/motm/vice-screen-2023050306364137.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When playing these earlier PC games it’s important to call out what they did right, and where they may have been innovative. This game starts off with some theme music and an animated introduction, the sets the stage for our character’s journey. Once you’re in your cabin and gain control of Sir Charles, you have an opportunity to move around and get acquainted with the controls.</p>

<p>You leave your cabin and start walking around, testing doors and learning how to navigate the ship. Eventually you’ll make your way from cabin #3 (your home cabin) to the other side of the ship and cabin #4. Once inside you discover a murder has taken place and it’s crime solving time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/motm/vice-screen-2023050306430613.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Unlike most verb-based adventure games, Murder on the Mississippi offers you only a handful of options on every screen. These options will change depending on whether there’s an NPC on screen or not, but ultimately you can always <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WALK AROUND</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INSPECT</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EXAMINE EVIDENCE</code>. Inspecting the environment is contextual, so you need to be “near” something that you can interact with (such as a table, cabinet, etc).</p>

<p>If you’re lucky, there may be a clue hidden in, around, behind or under whatever you happen to be inspecting.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/motm/vice-screen-2023050406284738.png" alt="" />
<em>Well look at that, there was a key under the pillow!</em></p>

<p>The ship contains 28 locations you can investigate (27 cabins and the wheelhouse where the captain is). Though this may seem like a lot, there are really only a handful of cabins that contain anything notable, and the cast of characters you can interact with is actually pretty small.</p>

<p>Since this is a murder mystery, interacting with characters to piece together their stories is a big part of the game. I found the approach they took here to be pretty clever, though it may not have been intuitive.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/motm/vice-screen-2023050407043564.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Every character you meet gives you the option to ask them about either (a) the victim, or (b) any other character you’ve already met. For each of these interactions you’re able to “take notes”, which involves moving the cursor over each word in their response and forming a sentence you may want to use when speaking to other characters.</p>

<p>This mechanic is clever, but actually extremely hard to get right. The thing is, you can ask characters about the victim as many times as you want, but you can only ask them about other characters once. If you forget to take notes, or you take the <em>wrong</em> note - you’re fucked.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/motm/vice-screen-2023051006082619.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you collect these notes, you can share them with other characters. This is how you advance the plot - assuming you wrote the write thing down in the first place. Incorrect notes give you a generic response, which sucks because you have no idea that you’re on the right track but asked the wrong thing.</p>

<p>I used a walkthrough for this portion so I’m not sure if it would have worked to just copy the entire response as the note (like copy literally everything every character said).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/motm/vice-screen-2023050406484155.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you find clues you’ll periodically have to go back to your cabin to stow them in the steamer trunk. This is both because your sidekick (Regis) can only carry so many items. Within the steamer trunk you’re able to examine individual items, or combine them by placing two items on the examination table and selecting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EXAMINE</code>.</p>

<p>There are a number of clues you can combine, and I’d highly recommend you examine everything (and all combinations) more than once. For example, once you unlock the rosewood box with the key and find what’s inside, examining it a second time reveals a false bottom with more clues in it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/motm/vice-screen-2023051006190505.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When you’re finally satisfied that you’ve solved the murder, the last thing to do is go to the character’s cabin you think is guilty and accuse them. This results in the characters being gathered together, a long exchange between all of them and Sir Charles and hopefully a confession from the killer.</p>

<p>Overall I found this game to be pretty well paced and engaging. There are a couple places where you can die because the killer has set traps that you’ll need to avoid and these will catch you by surprise the first time - so save A LOT. Similarly every time I wanted to ask a character about what another character was saying I’d save before taking notes in case what I noted ended up not getting a response.</p>

<p>The note taking/sharing was interesting but ultimately frustrating as it’s so easy to get wrong. Thankfully there weren’t too many combinations you of note and characters, and it became increasingly easy to determine when characters weren’t sharing anything noteworthy (so you could skip taking notes on those responses).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/motm/vice-screen-2023051006232817.png" alt="" />
<em>If all goes well you make it to New Orleans</em></p>

<p>I didn’t think I was going to like this game, but in the end I really did. The music is pretty simple - but it’s there. Every character has their own tune that plays when you enter their cabin, there’s background music as you walk around the ship and you get occasional sound effects as you bump into things as you investigate.</p>

<p>Murder on the Mississippi is not a great game, but I had a good time working through the mystery and eventually finding the killer. Though you literally have to investigate EVERYTHING to try and surface clues where there’s no indication anything might exist, the game is still pretty short and can be enjoyable (unless you’re <a href="https://originalnews.nico/372062">this Japanese gamer that spent 2 years making a strategy guide to clear the game</a>).</p>

This can result in increased latency when measuring the time to response of an operation following a cold start, so it’s worth understanding what the anatomy of an authenticated connection is - as well as what can be done to improve an initial operations round trip time (RTT).</p>

<h1 id="current-state">Current State</h1>

<p><img src="/images/mongo-auth-01.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="connection-protocol">Connection Protocol</h2>

<p>Typically a MongoDB connection string will contain a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#std-label-connections-standard-connection-string-format">standard seed list</a>, which is represented by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongodb://</code> protocol followed by a list of servers (ex: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongodb://localhost:27017,localhost:27018....</code>).</p>

<p>Starting with MongoDB 3.6 instead of having to provide the seed list in the connection string manually a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#std-label-connections-dns-seedlist">DNS-constructed seed list</a> could be used as well. With this configuration the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongodb+srv://</code> protocol is used to communicate both the seed list as well as any options by performing two (2) DNS queries to resolve the following DNS records: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV_record"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SRV</code></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TXT_record"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TXT</code></a>.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-3-6-here-to-srv-you-with-easier-replica-set-connections"><em>“MongoDB 3.6: Here to SRV you with easier replica set connections”</em></a> for more information regarding this topic.</p>

<p>Additionally there may be an RTT for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AAAA</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CNAME</code> resolution, however these may be done in parallel and may also be cached. <a href="https://www.cloudns.net/blog/dns-cache-explained/">DNS Caching</a> will likely improve the performance of these queries, but it’s worth noting their presence within the connection establishment and authentication lifecycle.</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that if the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SRV</code> record returns multiple hosts, those <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AAAA</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CNAME</code> records will be resolved in parallel. And DNS servers typically will optimize the traversal returning any intermediate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CNAME</code>s followed by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AAAA</code> in the same request.</p>

<p>This also assumes UDP-based DNS resolution. If you exceed the UDP packet size, you might first try UDP, receive an error, and retry using TCP (and possibly requiring a TCP handshake to the DNS server as well).</p>

<p>Once a host is known from the seed list, next we need to connect to it. This is done using a standard <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-3-way-handshake-process/">TCP 3-way Handshake</a>, which constitutes 1 RTT. Note that as there is an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ACK</code> sent following the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SYN/ACK</code> this handshake is sometimes considered to be <a href="https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/a/76369">1.5 RTT</a>, however most TCP stacks will send the first data packet with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ACK</code>.</p>

<h2 id="mongodb-handshake">MongoDB Handshake</h2>

<p>Now that we have established a TLS secured TCP socket connection to a MongoDB host (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongos</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongod</code>), the MongoDB Driver will send a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/hello/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello</code></a> command to perform <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/mongodb-handshake/handshake.rst">the initial handshake</a>.</p>

<p>This step is required to determine that the host at the other end of the socket is actually a MongoDB server. Assuming the version of the MongoDB Driver supports MongoDB 4.4+ the handshake will also include a <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/mongodb-handshake/handshake.rst#speculative-authentication"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">speculativeAuthenticate</code></a> argument. Specifying this argument to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello</code> will speculatively include the first command of an authentication handshake, thus eliminating one round trip as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">saslStart</code> command doesn’t need to be sent during the authentication handshake.</p>

<h2 id="authentication-handshake">Authentication Handshake</h2>

<p>MongoDB supports a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Authentication_and_Security_Layer">SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer)</a> mechanisms. By default the SASL mechanism that will be used will be a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/security-scram/">SCRAM</a> mechanism (either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-1</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-256</code>), which effectively means “username and password”. Note that this is a “challenge response” mechanism, so these credentials aren’t broadcast in the clear.</p>

<p>As outlined in the <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/auth/auth.rst#id8">MongoDB Authentication specification</a>, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-256</code> conversation will be made up of 2 round trips as follows:</p>

<p>MongoDB 4.4 has been out since at least <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/4.4/#4.4.1---sep-9--2020">September 2020</a>, so chances are most applications are connecting to at least this version or newer. This would put the average round trip count for authenticating a connection between 6 and 9 (depending on what protocol is being used and if DNS results were previously cached).</p>

<p>Next let’s review what can be done to reduce these round trips where possible.</p>

<h2 id="use-x509-authentication">Use x.509 Authentication</h2>

<p>When using <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/configure-x509-client-authentication/">x.509 certificates to authenticate clients</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/auth/auth.rst/#mongodb-x509">conversation</a> with the server does not require a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">saslContinue</code>. Assuming this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">speculativeAuthenticate</code> of the initial handshake succeeds (which it should), two full round trip can be removed!</p>

<p>Note there’s no authentication round trips as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">speculativeAuthenticate</code> succeeding contains the information typically sent via the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">saslStart</code> command.</p>

<p>As a Product Manager, data is everything when it comes to making decisions. One of my responsibilities as a PM for Developer Interfaces is to understand how our developer communities work most effectively, and what their preferred tooling and stacks look like.</p>

<p>When focusing on the Ruby developer community, a simple question to ask would be <em>“What is your favourite editor/IDE when working with Ruby / Rails?”</em> JetBrains’ developer survey from 2021 found that <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2021/ruby/#Ruby_what-editor-ide-do-you-mostly-use-for-ruby-development">48% of Ruby developers mostly use RubyMine</a> - which may be accurate - but the survey was run by the vendor responsible for RubyMine and may have skewed results based on their sample group consisting of fans/customers/users of their products.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>I wanted to try running my own survey to see if the responses align with what JetBrains found. Since my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/12yjgwh/favorite_editoride_when_working_with_ruby_rails/">Reddit survey</a> was conducted 2 years after JetBrains’ how have things changed?</p>

<p>This was my first time running a Reddit poll, but found the community to be extremely engaged and willing to provide honest and targeted feedback. I only setup the poll to run for 72 hours, but during that time period I received:</p>

<ul>
  <li>931 Votes</li>
  <li>20K Total Views</li>
  <li>50 Upvotes</li>
  <li>41 Comments</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately Reddit doesn’t appear to consistently present engagement statistics (views, upvotes) so this is an approximation based on observation during the period the poll was open.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>The poll contained 6 options (the maximum Reddit allows) and was open from 2023-04-25 to 2023-04-28.</p>

<p>The fact that <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> was almost half of the poll’s respondents favourite editor wasn’t surprising, however over a quarter still favoured <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine</a>. This is far less that what JetBrains found, but my sample size is much smaller and audience potentially more diverse. Still the size of the user base for RubyMine is large enough that it should not be discounted when developing strategies when discussing developer tooling for Ruby specifically!</p>

<p>Also minor fun fact since the topic here is Ruby developer tooling. This blog is built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and the chart above was created using <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/">Mermaid</a> and a script similar to the <a href="https://github.com/jasonbellamy/jekyll-mermaid">jekyll-mermaid</a> plugin using a code block like the one below:</p>

<h2 id="outcome">Outcome</h2>

<p>The goal of this exercise was to learn 2 things specifically:</p>

<p><strong>Based on Reddit, what are Ruby developers favourite IDEs or Editors</strong></p>

<p>The main IDEs/Editors currently favoured by the users I polled were Visual Studio Code, Neovim and RubyMine. I had an entry in the poll of <em>“Other”</em>, which I believe (based on the comments) is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://macromates.com/">Textmate</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/atom">Atom</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Developers also seem to prefer editors that support <a href="https://solargraph.org/">Solargraph</a> for Intellisense.</p>

<p><strong>Is Reddit a good platform for this type of exercise</strong></p>

<p>Depending on the community/subreddit you choose to run the poll in your mileage may vary. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/">r/rails</a> subreddit has 57K users, so the chances of getting decent engagement were moderate, and given that I only ran this poll for 3 days I feel the response rate was quite high.</p>

<p>I will definitely use this method again in the future.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>When promoting this poll I posted to LinkedIn and Twitter only. Some of the feedback I got alluded to Reddit potentially discouraging some participation as users may not have accounts and may not want to create an account just to vote in a poll. Further to this, Reddit limits the number of items you can include in your poll to 6 items and it seems <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/hach42/why_is_there_a_6choice_poll_limit/">this is by design and won’t be increased any time soon</a>.</p>

<p>Being able to capture feedback from participants without there being a barrier to entry (like creating an account on Reddit) may improve engagement, however there is definite value in targeting a poll directly to the community represented in a subreddit.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Product Management" /><category term="survey" /><category term="ruby" /><category term="rails" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cross posted to DEV]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.alexbevi.com/images/ruby-banner.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.alexbevi.com/images/ruby-banner.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Mission Asteroid (On-Line Systems) - 1980</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2023/04/26/mission-asteroid/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mission Asteroid (On-Line Systems) - 1980" /><published>2023-04-26T20:27:47-04:00</published><updated>2023-05-11T12:28:38-04:00</updated><id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2023/04/26/mission-asteroid</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2023/04/26/mission-asteroid/"><![CDATA[<blockquote class="prompt-info">

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Asteroid">Mission Asteroid</a> is a graphic adventure game for the Apple II written by Ken and Roberta Williams and released in 1980 by On-Line Systems. It was later ported to the Atari 8-bit family and Commodore 64.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/asteroid/screenshot-2023-April-26-19-57-13.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You’re not really introduced to the game in any way other than being plopped from the title screen to the first playable screen, but apparently an asteroid is on a collision course with the earth, and you play as an astronaut tasked with flying to the asteroid and blowing it up before it’s too late.</p>

<p>I don’t want to say the plot of the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armageddon_(1998_film)">Armageddon</a> was <em>very loosely</em> based on this game (because I have zero evidence to back this up), but I want to believe it’s possible …</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/asteroid/screenshot-2023-April-26-20-03-35.png" alt="" />
<em>The graphics may not be great … but at least it’s not JUST text on screen right?</em></p>

<p>For a game released in 1980, the graphics actually aren’t too bad - though the character portraits really look like they were drawn by a child. Seeing as these early games weren’t using bitmap graphics but vector-ish graphics as each scene is “drawn” from coordinate details, I’m guessing their tooling was limited and this was the best of the best at that time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/asteroid/screenshot-2023-April-26-20-18-43.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/">ScummVM</a> supports all these <a href="https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/ADL">ADL engine</a> games, I chose to play the Apple II version on <a href="https://paleotronic.com/software/microm8/">microM8</a> just to give myself an excuse to try out a new emulator. I play a lot of these games on an old MacBook Pro, and my go to for emulating Apple II games was <a href="https://github.com/AppleWin/AppleWin">AppleWin</a>, so it’s good to know I have a viable alternative for OSX now.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/asteroid/screenshot-2023-April-26-20-17-18.png" alt="" />
<em>Ah shit, I <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PUSH</code>ed the throttle instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PULL</code>ing it … and now I’m dead</em></p>

<p>It wouldn’t be a Sierra On-Line game without you being able to fuck up and die by typing the wrong command, and Mission Asteroid is no different. There really aren’t that many game screens to explore so your chances of messing up are pretty slim - but they do exist.</p>

<p>As with any of these early adventure games, save early and save often.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/asteroid/screenshot-2023-April-26-20-24-48.png" alt="" />
<em>Ken and Roberta thank you for saving the planet!</em></p>

<p>This game was promoted as an entry level game to get players used to these types of adventure games, so you can forgive the simplicity. There’s no real character or plot development, no music and I don’t think there were really any sound effects.</p>

<p>If you’re just starting out with adventure games I highly doubt you’d be going back <em>this far</em> as your entry point into the genre, but if you do this is a pretty easy game to get you going.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Quest_II">King’s Quest II: Romancing the Throne</a> is the second installment in the King’s Quest series of graphic adventure games by Sierra On-Line. It was originally released in 1985 for PC DOS/PCjr, and later made available for the Apple II/IIGS, Atari ST, and Amiga. It uses the same AGI game engine as King’s Quest I: Quest for the Crown and features King Graham as the player character. The title is a spoof of the 1984 film Romancing the Stone.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq2/scummvm-kq2-00001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Since the events of the first game you’ve taken over as king of Daventry, but are now getting lonely and want to go out and meet some women. Since Tinder doesn’t exist yet you rely on your magic mirror to find you a suitable match - which it does. Having seen a princess locked up in a tower somewhere you set off on an adventure to save said princess, bring her back with you and make her your queen.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq2/scummvm-kq2-00002.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This followup entry to <a href="/blog/2021/08/06/kings-quest/">King’s Quest: Quest for the Crown</a> uses the same AGI game engine. Being parser-based you have to type your commands in and they will be interpreted based on how well you’ve conveyed your intent. The types of interactions you can have are pretty limited, but you can forgive game engines from the mid-80s for their lack of sophistication.</p>

<p>Most interactions will follow the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VERB SUBJECT</code> format, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TALK MAN</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET TRIDENT</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq2/scummvm-kq2-00012.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Make sure you <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code> at everything, and if it is potentially something you can pick up, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET</code> it. These early Sierra games are essentially just a series of item combination puzzles, and you can find yourself in unwinnable situations if you forgot to get something early on. Personally I find this to be part of the appeal of these games, as it really forces you to be meticulous with how you approach each screen.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq2/scummvm-kq2-00005.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For some reason this world is populated with fairy tale characters such as Little Red Riding hood, a fairy godmother … and Dracula. You’re not really given any background as to <em>why</em> these characters exist in this universe so you sort of just have to accept it.</p>

<p>What this game introduces that I don’t believe was in the previous game is time-delayed events on certain screens. For example, you’ll need to give Red Riding Hood a basket of food, but she only appears on certain screens - and only after waiting on that screen for a random amount of time. These types of puzzles are needlessly frustrating as you have no indication that (a) you’re on the right screen, (b) you’ve waited long enough and should exit/re-enter/try-again or (c) the event will be triggered at all.</p>

<p>Again, I’ll forgive these puzzle designs due to how old the game is … but it is extremely frustrating when you have to move between screens and just stand there waiting - hoping to trigger some event.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq2/scummvm-kq2-00013.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though the graphics really aren’t all that much better than the first game, for 1985 this was pretty impressive. The AGI engine is essentially a vector graphics engine as each screen is “drawn” based on the coordinate and fill instructions provided by the artists. Priority maps on each screen also create a sense of depth as you’re able to walk in front of or behind scenery, or be blocked from progressing if you collide with something you shouldn’t be able to walk through.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq2/scummvm-kq2-00003.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Your goal is to find 3 golden keys that can be used to unlock the 3 nested doors to the realm where Valanice is imprisoned. Reading the inscription on the doors will give you a clue as to where the key is, which you then need to find and ue to unlock the door. The clues are pretty vague, but since the game world is small as long as you pick everything up, talk to everyone and try every combination of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GIVE &lt;X&gt; TO &lt;Y&gt;</code> on each screen you should be able to sort most puzzles out.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq2/scummvm-kq2-00004.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Being a Sierra game, expect to die a lot. Though there aren’t too many stairs you can fall from in this game, there are still plenty of missteps that will kill you. If you fall into water, don’t forget to type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SWIM</code> so you don’t drown. This game gives you a shortcut for that action (I think you press the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=</code>), so this is an improvement over the original at least.</p>

<p>Assuming you try every combination of items, character interactions and wait on every screen for any potential timed events to trigger you’ll still be able to breeze through this game in a couple hours. If you use a walkthrough, you can finish in about 45 minutes.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq2/scummvm-kq2-00017.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you open all the magic doors and step through, you’ll make your way to the ivory tower and rescue the princess. To finish the game you need to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KISS</code> her (make sure you’re standing close enough), then say <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HOME</code> to magically return to Daventry. There must have been clues alluding to these steps somewhere during the game that I missed, but I found myself stuck here for a bit until I resorted to a walkthrough. The whole “say the magic word” thing wasn’t clear at all …</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/kq2/scummvm-kq2-00019.png" alt="" />
<em>The End</em></p>

<p>Overall, this game’s fine. It’s a sequel using the same game engine that tells the continuation of King Graham’s story. There’s not a lot of improvement over the original, there’s no real background music or sound effects other than certain screens. Other than your motivation for going from point A to B being “find the girl” there’s not much story or character development.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.agdinteractive.com/games/kq2/about/about.html">AGD Interactive released a remake</a> of this game with updated graphics, sound and music in 2002. Though I haven’t played it myself I’ve heard nothing but good things about it (and their <a href="http://www.agdinteractive.com/games/games.html">other games</a>), so if you’re looking to play this game maybe skip the original and go straight to the remake.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(video_game)">Countdown</a> you play as Mason Powers, a CIA agent who wakes up in a Turkish mental hospital, suffering from partial amnesia and accused of murdering his supervisor. Powers must escape the hospital, find out who framed him, piece together his memory, and prevent terrorists from blowing up a peace conference.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/countdown/count_004.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As the title of the game implies, you’ve got a limited time to finish this game before the bomb goes off. I’m not actually sure if this is communicated as you first start playing or if it’s in the game manual, but you’ve apparently only got 96 hours of game time to get everything sorted out.</p>

<p>You start off in the insane asylum and can see something glinting under the bed. Using the mouse you can select from a number of verbs, which you then use to interact with the game environment.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/countdown/count_007.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Character movement appears to be rotoscoped, and instead of tiny sprites on screen everything is big and detailed. Though this game seems to use a similar engine as <a href="/blog/2023/01/19/mean-streets/">Mean Streets</a> (which only came out a year earlier), the quality of the graphics is much much better. You can move Mason around the screen with the keyboard and use the mouse to interact with the environment.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/countdown/count_029.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you progress you’ll encounter certain characters you can interact with. This is done via a menu that offers options as to how you can approach the conversation. For example, you can ask for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HELP</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HASSLE</code> them, be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PLEASANT</code>, try to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BLUFF</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OFFER</code> something or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ASK ABOUT</code> a keyword. There’s actually a HUGE amount of trial and error required here as you need to try different approaches (combinations of actions) with each character before they’ll let you ask them about anything.</p>

<p>This isn’t immediately obvious and if you don’t approach a conversation correctly you need to exit and re-initiate or you can’t proceed. This is not intuitive and can leave you feeling like you’ve hit a dead end.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/countdown/count_012.png" alt="" />
<em>Oh goody, a maze</em></p>

<p>Some game sequences involve an overhead view where you have to avoid guards as you make your way to the next room. The guards will all follow a predetermined path so once you know what this is it’s not that hard to avoid them. Unfortunately when you leave a room and go back into one of these scenes the guards may be nearby and if they spot you it’s game over, so make sure to save often.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/countdown/count_005.png" alt="" />
<em>Trying to escape from the asylum will result in you getting caught … a lot</em></p>

<p>To escape the initial sequence in the asylum you also have to navigate an arbitrary maze. Thankfully there are no guards in this section, but I hate mazes and find them tedious … and this one was no different. It really feels like it’s artificially delaying your progress and is just “busy work” for the player. Thankfully this is the only maze in the game :)</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/countdown/count_030.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Travel in this game is done via a menu, and you can select to either take a train or a plane to most destinations. Taking the train will take much longer (time-wise) and since the game is on a timer this can be problematic. The endgame sequence requires you to catch a train to Paris, but if you’ve taken too long getting to the terminal the train will be gone and you have to start over (either from an old save file, or from the very beginning).</p>

<p>Unlike Mean Streets the travel mechanics in this game are pretty straightforward, but you have limited money to move around Europe with so make sure you’re paying attention as the story unfolds and try not to backtrack too often.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/countdown/count_027.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When you return to your apartment you’ll find a CAD system, which is sort of like a laptop. This can be used to look up information on characters you learn about, analyze inventory items or read email. You’ll only get a couple email messages throughout the game, and when you read them they’re gone … so pay close attention.</p>

<p>Certain items (such as notes, memos or documents) can be analyzed. This is done by zooming in and out using the CAD system, which at a certain resolution will result in you being able to read some additional text on screen. Once you find the correct resolution you’ll typically be given an additional keyword you can ask characters about or a new location you can travel to.</p>

<p>Unfortunately as new information becomes available you’re not given any audio or visual cue.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/countdown/count_032.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The story is actually quite good, and each character you interact with drops clues as to how you ended up in the asylum, who you work for, what the mission was and ultimately what you need to do to stop the terrorist plot. Assuming you don’t miss anything by approaching a conversation incorrectly you’ll be able to piece everything together from these interactions.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/countdown/count_031.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Not everything is obvious though … For example, in Venice after you meet with the stripper and get some additional information from her you’ll want to search her dressing room. You don’t know this is a goal, but assuming you do you’ll need to wait for the guard to leave. There are no clues that the guard even will leave, so unless you have the foresight to just stand still for 2-3 minutes until he moves … you’re stuck.</p>

<p>This was not obvious, and from the character interactions in this area there are no clues that he might leave on his own for some reason.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/countdown/count_035.png" alt="" />
<em>Move the brick next to his leg. No, not that brick, the other one … no, the other one … ARGH</em></p>

<p>As good as the story may be, this game is HARD. You can’t move the mouse around the screen and have hotspots identified - you have to select a verb and click on EVERYTHING. What’s worse is on some screens there are SO MANY dead ends that you can interact with but don’t really offer anything useful. Additionally, you’ll need to try and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MOVE</code> literally EVERYTHING.</p>

<p>This game mechanic must be a carryover from Mean Streets - where it was also extremely frustrating. You never know when something will be hidden <em>beneath</em> something else.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/countdown/count_034.png" alt="" />
<em>Nice kitty!</em></p>

<p>There are a handful of puzzle sequences as well. Most puzzles are pretty straightforward, but you’ll likely still die a dozen times trying to get the timing “just right”. For example, when you’re captured and tied up above a tiger, once the rope burns and you fall you need to lure the tiger into a cage, then run out and close the cage. This seems easy, but trying to navigate the mouse and keyboard together fast enough will result in the tiger getting out and eating you the first few tries.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/countdown/count_037.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If all goes well and you didn’t forget to pick up any key items, and you didn’t screw up any of the character interactions, and you didn’t run out of money, and you didn’t run out of time, and you didn’t get stuck because a puzzle was non-obvious … you’ll make it to Paris where you have 60 seconds to defuse an atomic bomb. No pressure …</p>

<p>Assuming you’ve used the CAD to review EVERYTHING you picked up one of the notes does give you the info you need to properly defuse the bomb (or you can just use a walkthrough). Once you complete this, the game is over and you’ve saved the world. Good job!</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/countdown/count_039.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I really liked this game, but found it to be pretty challenging. You’ll die A LOT just trying to get out of the initial sequence in the asylum, and you might blow a good hour in the basement maze if you suck at mazes like I do …</p>

<p>The underlying story is compelling and kept me interested enough to keep on plugging away to the end. If you’re going to try this out for yourself, be warned that this is definitely an adventure game from the “non-LucasArts” camp, where you can die literally everywhere, and end up in unwinnable situations.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beavis_and_Butt-Head_in_Virtual_Stupidity">Beavis and Butt-Head in Virtual Stupidity</a> is a point-and-click adventure computer game based on the American animated television series created by Mike Judge, Beavis and Butt-Head, that was developed by ICOM Simulations and published by Viacom New Media.</p>

<p>I have fond memories of Beavis and Butthead so I expected this playthrough to be done through some rose coloured glasses as a result. To be fair, the voice acting was excellent and the plot really felt like something lifted from one of the episodes.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/bbvs/scummvm-bbvs-00023.png" alt="" />
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwar">GWAR</a> still kicks ass! RIP Dave Brockie :(</em></p>

<p>If you click on some of the TVs in the game they’ll play music videos mixed with Beavis and Butthead’s commentary. From what I could remember watching this show growing up that commentary made up the vast majority of the show and was the best part, so including it in the game was a nice bonus when you found it. I actually don’t remember there being very much “cartoon content” in each episode …</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/bbvs/scummvm-bbvs-00003.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As far as adventure games go this title doesn’t really add anything to the overall gaming landscape. Instead of a verb menu or action bar, when you right click on the screen you get a ring menu (similar to <a href="/blog/2023/03/10/full-throttle/">Full Throttle</a>) which you use to select an action. The standard fare are here such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MOVE</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TALK</code>and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">USE</code>, as well as access to your inventory.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/bbvs/scummvm-bbvs-00012.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I’m guessing the interactions in this game were heavily inspired by LucasArts, as the character interactions feel like they were lifted directly from <a href="/blog/2023/01/23/sam-and-max-hit-the-road/">Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road</a>. As you navigate the game world you talk to various characters or interact with elements of the environment which will then be available as options when talking to certain characters. This is how you advance through the plot of this game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/bbvs/scummvm-bbvs-00011.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The plot is pretty straightforward, and feels perfectly aligned with an episode of Beavis and Butthead. You run into Todd, who you think is super cool because he’s always threatening you so you want to join his gang. Once you escape from your high school, you roam around Highland (Texas) trying get “in” with Todd, which results in you getting up to all sorts of mischief, including being thrown in jail.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/bbvs/scummvm-bbvs-00004.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Throughout the game there are a series of mini-games that you can optionally play. The Hock-a-Loogie game is the only one you actually have to complete as hitting the principal with a super-loogie is the only way to get him to run inside, which allows you to sneak out of school and progress the game.</p>

<p>Each mini-game can be replayed whenever you want, including from a menu present at the title screen. These mini-games are all pretty stupid and extremely repetitive, but seeing as they’re mostly optional it’s kind of nice knowing they exist as a distraction only.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/bbvs/scummvm-bbvs-00013.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This wouldn’t be an adventure game if it wasn’t full of fetch quests and item combination puzzles. Make sure you try an pickup everything on every screen as the solutions to some of the puzzles in this game aren’t obvious. I chuckled a bit in the prison sequence where you had to distract an inmate by blinding him with a camera and flash, but to do this you had to find a flashcube and combine it with the camera first.</p>

<p>I’ve got a feeling anyone born after 2000 might not know what a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_(photography)#flashcube">flashcube</a> is …</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/bbvs/scummvm-bbvs-00015.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Animated cutscenes are mixed in throughout the game, which further assist with progressing the plot. The graphics of the game are descent and the downsampled graphics on the cutscenes actually make them feel more immersive with the game as the transition is more subtle.</p>

<p>When you finally reach the endgame you’ve rescued Todd, he’s about to let you join the gang - but you’re raided by the police and accidentally finger Todd as the perpetrator and he gets hauled off to prison. Better luck next time … I guess :P</p>

<p>There is a very narrow audience that this game would appeal to - though I have to admit I can count myself a member of that audience. It’s unlikely you’ll try this game out if you didn’t watch the original show, though some folks might stumble into this if they enjoyed 2022’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beavis_and_Butt-Head_Do_the_Universe">Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/bbvs/scummvm-bbvs-00022.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I don’t think you’d consider the humour in this game “raunchy” by any means, but in the mid 90’s standards were a lot higher (or lower?). You know what you’re getting into when you pick up this title, and honestly it doesn’t really disappoint. It’s not a great game, but for a one time playthrough you’ll have a good time.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_Vu_(video_game)">Déjà Vu</a> is a point-and-click adventure game set in the world of 1940s hardboiled detective novels and movies. It was released in 1985 for Macintosh – the first in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacVenture">MacVenture</a> series – and later ported to several other systems.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dejavu/deja-vu-04.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game takes place in Chicago during December 1941. The game character is Ace Harding, a retired boxer working as a private eye. Ace awakes one morning in a bathroom stall, unable to remember who he is. A dead man is found in an upstairs office, and Ace is about to be framed for the murder. There are some clues as to the identity of the murdered man and to Ace himself. A strap-down chair, mysterious vials, and a syringe are found, suggesting (together with a needle mark on Ace’s arm) that an interrogation has taken place.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dejavu/deja-vu-25.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As this is a MacVentures game the interface is laid out in a familiar fashion. The game world occupies a third of the screen, which you engage with by selecting a verb from the bottom section of the screen then clicking on. Having been designed with a mouse in mind, the NES port (which I’m playing) is a bit cumbersome to navigate, but as this was my first exposure to these titles I’m willing to be forgiving of these shortcomings.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dejavu/deja-vu-19.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Your goal is to figure out who you are and to clear your name once you realize you’re being framed for murder. This is done by collecting and analyzing evidence on every screen. Be warned - there is A LOT you can pick up and it’s not all useful.</p>

<p>This is done by first selecting a verb (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EXAM</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SPEAK</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HIT</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CLOSE</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OPEN</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TAKE</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LEAVE</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">USE</code>), then moving the cursor over the target you want to interact with. There is no visual indication that what you’re trying to interact with will be valid, so there’s a lot of trial and error as you move through the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dejavu/deja-vu-26.png" alt="" />
<em>Remember that random pencil you found … I hope you remembered to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TAKE</code> it with you …</em></p>

<p>Inventory management is a huge part of this game as the goal is to find clues not only to your identity but eventually to clear your name as you’ve been framed for murder. Items can be nested 2 or 3 levels deep, so you’ll need to make sure you try and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OPEN</code> <em>everything</em>. Additionally there are item combination puzzles so you’ll want to make sure to try using items with each other.</p>

<p>The game world is split between multiple locations that you need to navigate between by taking a cab. Each cab ride costs $0.75, but you have a limited number of coins. In the basement of Joe’s Bar there’s a casino where you can play the slot machines to try and earn some extra money. If you gamble away all your coins you’ll end up in an unwinnable situation … so save early and save often ;)</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dejavu/deja-vu-08.png" alt="" />
<em>Make sure you save your game before playing the slot machines … just in case</em></p>

<p>As you progress through the story you’ll realize you’ve been drugged, which is affecting your memory. Once you identify the what you’ve been given and what the remedy is, figure out how to administer this to yourself and do it without accidentally dying … you learn who you are, but this doesn’t really clear up what you need to do to proceed through to the end of the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dejavu/deja-vu-20.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I actually found this part a bit frustrating as I didn’t originally find the capsules and couldn’t take the medicine that’s supposed to restore your memory. Once I got a walkthrough and backtracked I was able to sort this out, but it sort of felt like a forced fetch quest - which I guess is pretty common of this genre of game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dejavu/deja-vu-28.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In the deepest parts of the sewer there’s an area where you can discard evidence permanently. This is how you win the game as you need to take the evidence you find that frames you for murder and dispose of it. If you don’t do this JUST RIGHT, when you go to the police station at the end of the game you’ll wind up just being arrested instead of cleared of all charges.</p>

<p>You can’t just randomly drop evidence either; it needs to be discarded in exactly this spot. This isn’t really clear while you’re playing the game, and I didn’t find any clues that indicated the sewer was where you needed to do this so I’m guessing it was meant to be a “trial and error” type of discovery for players. I didn’t love this as it’s not very intuitive, and really the game doesn’t make it apparent how you’re supposed to “win”.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dejavu/deja-vu-27.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Make sure you save often as you play as there are multiple areas where you can be randomly killed. In the sewers you may run into a crocodile that will eat you and there are muggers randomly trying to rob and kill you. You can knock the mugger out a couple times using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HIT</code>, but after that you have to give him cash or he’ll shoot you.</p>

<p>You’ll likely also die a few times by taking the wrong medicine trying to clear up your lost memory, or just using the wrong items on yourself trying to figure out what is useful. This is part of the fun of adventure games though so roll the dice and see what does and doesn’t kill you :D</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/dejavu/deja-vu-32.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Overall this game has a decent story, and the NES port has pretty good music. I never tried playing any of the other ports so I’m not sure how they fare, but aside from the DOS version with the gross colour palette they seem to look ok as well.</p>

<p>Seeing as this was their first game I can forgive some of the technical and procedural challenges I had finishing it. It is kind of weird knowing that this is the same company that ended up making licensed Beavis and Butthead games in the ’90s like <a href="/blog/2023/04/16/beavis-and-butthead/">Beavis and Butt-Head in Virtual Stupidity</a>.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to playing the sequel to see where this story goes.</p>
