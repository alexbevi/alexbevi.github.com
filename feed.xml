<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_of_the_Amazon_Queen">Flight of the Amazon Queen</a> is a graphical point-and-click adventure game by Interactive Binary Illusions, originally released in 1995 for Amiga and MS-DOS.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/queen/scummvm-queen-00024.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Joe King is the hero of this point and click adventure. His plane is carrying actress Faye Russell when it crash lands in a remote jungle, and he must battle through 100 screens of adventure and puzzle. The game’s feel is influenced by hammy B-movies, and the characters are quite stereotyped and comic. As standard in point and click adventures, a set of icons at the bottom of the screen allow you to interact with visible characters and items in the main view area.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/queen/scummvm-queen-00029.png" alt="" />
<em>I’m shocked they don’t lean into this pun more often throughout the game</em></p>

<p>I’m a huge fan of LucasArts games, and after reading <a href="https://passfieldgames.blogspot.com/2015/05/making-of-flight-of-amazon-queen-20th.html">“Making of Flight of the Amazon Queen - A 20th Anniversary Retrospective”</a> it seems that so was John Passfield. So many aspects of Flight of the Amazon Queen just smack of LucasArts’ influence, and the end result is a game that could easily live alongside classics such as <a href="/blog/2024/04/30/the-secret-of-monkey-island/">The Secret of Monkey Island</a> or Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/queen/scummvm-queen-00032.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Ron Gilbert and Tim Schafer’s influence on this game runs extremely deep. The comedic writing style, pixel art design, verb selection and dialog tree layout all feel reminiscent of a LucasArts title, and though they didn’t use the SCUMM engine, they’re custom game engine was titled JASPAR (John And Steve’s Programmable Adventure Resource) - which sort of feels like it belongs in that universe of tools with forced acronyms.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/queen/scummvm-queen-00004.png" alt="" />
<em>Adding that “trademark” next to “comedy breasts” just screams of Monkey Island’s influence</em></p>

<p>Once the game starts you’ll find yourself locked in a hotel room that you need to escape. You’re a pilot for hire, and your next client is a famous movie star, but your rival Anderson wants to steal this job from you. To escape the hotel room you’ll need to use the various verbs represented as icons to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PICK UP</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">USE</code> various things.</p>

<p>Most of this game involves inventory combination puzzles and fetch quests, so it’s worth examining everything on the screen to see if it’s something you can pick up, move, open/close or use.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/queen/scummvm-queen-00011.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This game is incredibly well paced, as long as you look at everything and talk to everyone. The path forward or solution to most puzzles is typically intuitive and when you need to combine items Joe will usually point you in the right direction.</p>

<p>When this gets a little more confusing is later in the game where you have a very large number of items - all of which you’ll need to use at some point (and often in combination).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/queen/scummvm-queen-00016.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game likes to plant seeds as to the solution to puzzles through story elements. For example there is a brief sequence early in the game where you find a comic book that your mechanic Sparky is looking for. If you read the comic the hero uses alcohol to power is jetpack when it runs out of fuel so he can escape from the baddies just in the nick of time.</p>

<p>Amazingly enough, near the end of the game you find a jetpack - but it doesn’t have any fuel. Trader bob has bottles of alcohol for sale (but you need to prove you’re of age so you need ID to show him).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/queen/scummvm-queen-00018.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You’ll meet a number of characters throughout the Amazon that you’ll interact with. Most characters only really have one purpose and it’s typically (a) they’re preventing you from progressing or (b) they hold some inventory item you’ll need.</p>

<p>Each character has a limited number of dialog options, so it’s worth asking everyone about everything as it helps advance the plot and lays out what that character needs from you in fairly straightforward language.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/queen/scummvm-queen-00014.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Trader Bob is the exception as you’ll need to circle back to him multiple times to get new items. I did appreciate that though there are dozens of useable items in this game, none of them appear to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring">red herrings</a>.</p>

<p>If an item will need to be used more than once, it will typically remain in your inventory in a depleted state to indicate it’s still needed. In my opinion this is better than the puzzle design in other games (notably a number of Sierra titles) where you have to backtrack to get an item again to use it as the solution to another puzzle.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/queen/scummvm-queen-00012.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Instead of the typical “map screen” you’d get in other games to navigate between game areas, Flight of the Amazon Queen has a pinnacle you walk to that overlooks the forest. From here you pan back and forth and can see the various locations you can travel to.</p>

<p>Technically it’s just a different take on the flat 2D map screen, but it’s also incorporated into the endgame as the location you need to launch from once you have the jetpack. Since you can’t travel back to the forest once you reach the Valley of the Mists it felt like a good way to tie the pinnacle you’ve been using for travel throughout the game into your journey towards the final encounter.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/queen/scummvm-queen-00015.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game’s tone is extremely light and a little goofy. Joe King just feels and plays like a caricature of Indiana Jones, and they have a lot of fun with this. Every character you interact with doesn’t take themselves too seriously, and the underlying stories they’re presenting are enjoyable and keep you engaged.</p>

<p>I really like imaginary gorilla that pops up a couple of times blocking your path. Just talking to the gorilla and picking one of the dialog options that results in you questioning whether or not he should even exist will cause him to vanish.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/queen/scummvm-queen-00008.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As the game progresses you’ll be presented with static cut scenes that further advance the plot. It turns out there’s a mad scientist trying to capture Amazonian women so he can test a dino ray on them that turns them into dinosaurs.</p>

<p>I guess he wants to create an army of dino-humans and conquer the world … and you’re the only one that can stop him.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/queen/scummvm-queen-00037.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It’s kind of bananas that Joe King - a parody of Indiana Jones - needs to retrieve a crystal skull from the depths of the Amazon in order to activate an ancient robot, and over a decade later <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Kingdom_of_the_Crystal_Skull">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a> did something sort of similar (but with aliens instead of ancient robots).</p>

<p>I know there’s almost no chance these two things are related, but in my mind I’m picturing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Koepp">David Koepp</a> (who wrote the screenplay for that movie) walking by his kid playing FOTAQ in 1995 and thinking “that crystal skull looks neat” … then carrying on with his life.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/queen/scummvm-queen-00038.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you play the MSDOS CD version of this game you’ll be treated to some fairly good voice acting. This enhances the game experience quite a bit as though there is some looping music in the background, it’s not really notable other than “being there”.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/68041/bradley-lavelle/">Bradley Lavelle</a> who provides Joe’s voice does a fantastic job and really gives the character some depth. His delivery is a little dry and sarcastic, but suits Joe King perfectly.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/queen/scummvm-queen-00043.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you’ve got the crystal skull, Dr. Frank Ironstein will unlock the Valley of the Mists where all the dinosaurs live and you’ll need to get yourself over there for the final battle. This final sequence is pretty short (compared to the rest of the game) and just sees you defeating Monster Frank (the doctor gets zapped with his own dino ray), restoring the veil of mist to the Valley of the Mists and flying off into the sunset with Princess Azura.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/queen/scummvm-queen-demo-00001.png" alt="" />
<em>There’s a hidden mini-game on the CD version where you interview the game developers about the game you just played!</em></p>

<p>Discovering how much you can enjoy a game is the whole reason for a retrospective series like this, and Flight of the Amazon Queen is one such title. The story is immersive, the puzzles are challenging but intuitive, the graphics are great and the writing is entertaining.</p>

<p>This is definitely a game I’d recommend to anyone that may be interested in experiencing what the genre has to offer. It’s even more impressive knowing that only a handful of people worked on this game originally - and if you have the CD version of the game with the “INTERVIE” directory on it, you can play a minigame where you interview the developers of the game about the game you just played!</p>

<p>Flight of the Amazon Queen was re-released as freeware in 2004, and was incorporated into ScummVM as the fifth engine (they currently have <a href="https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Engines">A LOT of game engines</a>). You can you can go <a href="https://scummvm.org/games/#games-queen:queen">download and enjoy</a> the game right now!</p>

<p>Historical game preservation and ScummVM specifically are close to my heart so I want to close out this review with the following excerpt from <a href="https://romchip.org/index.php/romchip-journal/article/view/164">“Beyond the Amiga: In Conversation with John Passfield on Flight of the Amazon Queen”</a> as it shines a light on how this all came to be:</p>
<blockquote class="prompt-tip">
  <p>HS: Can you tell us about the involvement of ScummVM in making the game accessible today?</p>

  <p>JP: I was approached from the ScummVM people and they were interested in making a version of Amazon Queen available through their online library of playable adventure games. I was aware at this point that new generation PCs that were coming out were making it harder to play Amazon Queen. And I thought, well, I own the intellectual property, so I made it freeware with the right that you download for free, but you couldn’t sell it. And I retained copyright ownership of the game and that’s when the ScummVM people come in. They reached out and said we’d love to convert Amazon Queen to the ScummVM engine. And I was that’d be great because then it lives on forever. So, they reached out and said can we do it? I said that would be great and a month later it’s available on ScummVM.</p>

  <p>HS: ScummVM does not rely on the emulation of hardware. The ScummVM team uses a different process to make games playable on contemporary computing environments. Can you explain how they do this?</p>

  <p>JP: I actually reached out to ScummVM on their Discord asking them how they went about it. What they explained is ScummVM is basically a framework for graphical programs which work with 2-D, and now 3-D, particularly with OpenGL. So, they provide middleware code which is called the OSystem. Then every game engine is ported to this middleware replacing or hardware dependent things like sound, graphical output, file reading, keyboard mouse input, times, et cetera, with a call to the OSystem. First off, they did this for the LucasArts Scumm engine. For my game they created the “Queen” engine. The Queen engine uses their middleware to interpret the game files for Amazon Queen. It’s completely different pieces of code having nothing in common with Scumm or any of the other four engines they had adapted at the time. Amazon Queen was the fifth engine they made compatible. They said because Amazon Queen had very little assembly, it was mostly C code, they said it was very easy to port over. And I think they’re obviously very smart people. So that’s how it came about and that is how it works. As mentioned, I believe they’ve got support now for the LucasArts games which have 3-D graphics.</p>

  <p>I just love what they’re doing because it just gives that capacity to keep the game playable. It outputs at C++ so it works for everything. When Liron, who did the re-release of Amazon Queen for iOS in 2009, approached me to ask if he could port it into iOS he used the ScummVM Queen engine version and built on top of that engine extra stuff for the iOS version. The way that arrangement worked is that I granted him a licence to sell for iOS and he gave me a royalty. He has also put it on to the PC now. ScummVM just keeps these games accessible, which is great.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Quest_IV">Space Quest IV: Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers</a> is a 1991 graphic adventure game by Sierra On-Line, and the fourth entry in the Space Quest series. The game was released originally on floppy disks on March 4, 1991, and later released on CD-ROM in December 1992 with full speech support; an Atari ST version was announced via Sierra Online’s magazine, Sierra News Magazine, but was later canceled. The game sees players assume the role of Roger Wilco, who is thrust into a new adventure across time and space where he must thwart the plans of an old foe that is seeking revenge against him.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq4/scummvm-sq4-cd-00000.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Roger Wilco is relaxing at his favorite pub somewhere in time and space when heavily armed soldiers enter the room. Carrying a parting message from Roger’s old nemesis, Sludge Vohaul, they plan to get rid of the janitorial hero, execution style. That is, until a man with an over-sized hair dryer helps Roger escape through a time rip into the future. Now Roger Wilco has woken up on his home planet, some time in a meta-fictional Space Quest XII. It is a grim, dystopian future: the series has gone to ruin without its hero, and Vohaul rules supreme. Roger must find a way to avoid Vohaul’s henchmen, fulfill his destiny, and learn about a few surprises that await him in his own future.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Unlike <a href="/blog/2024/02/16/space-quest-iii/">Space Quest III</a> before it, Space Quest IV has discarded the text parser in favour of a true point-and-click interface. This time around you interact with the game world using the (likely far more familiar) verb-based icons to decide how Roger interacts with the game world.</p>

<p>A couple of of these options such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SMELL</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TASTE</code> really aren’t needed, though selecting them and clicking around allows for the game to spit out some pretty funny feedback about things you really shouldn’t be doing with your surroundings.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq4/scummvm-sq4-cd-00001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Space Quest series has never tried to take itself seriously, and this entry is no exception. The writing and the art style tend to be goofy, and there are a lot of “in jokes” for fans of this series as well as other Sierra Online games.</p>

<p>After the intro cutscene you’re dropped into the future, which the game’s menu bar tells you is <em>Space Quest XII - Vohaul’s Revenge II</em>. As you jump through time you’ll know “when” you are as the game you’ve landed in will be displayed here.</p>

<p>Once you find your way into the sewers a Star Wars parody plays out that informs you that some time in the past someone found an old Leisure Suit Larry game and uploaded it ot the Xenon super computer. This unleashed a virus (that I think contained Sludge Vohaul’s mind or something) that results in humanity being enslaved.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq4/scummvm-sq4-cd-00017.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Vohaul is sending androids after you called “Sequel Police”, who use time pods to jump through time. You eventually steal one of these, which requires you to enter a 6 digit time code to jump between games … but where do you find these codes?</p>

<p>This wasn’t immediately obvious to me, but in retrospect it sort of makes sense. When you first steal the time pod in SQXII the code onscreen is the return code for SQXII. I just got in and mashed some random codes and hit enter and the game sent me off to the next time period.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq4/scummvm-sq4-cd-00006.png" alt="" />
<em>I wonder if these assets were reused from a Leisure Suite Larry game 🧐</em></p>

<p>You’ll wind up in <em>Space Quest X - Latex Babes of Estros</em>, which is apparently a parody of Infocom’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather_Goddesses_of_Phobos">Leather Goddesses of Phobos</a> (what are the odds anyone playing this game today would make that connection).</p>

<p>This sequence is pretty short and straightforward and ends with you getting captured by a group of Amazonian women, saving them from a giant sea slug … then the lot of you heading out to the Galaxy Galleria mall to go on a shopping spree.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq4/scummvm-sq4-cd-00008.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are some throwbacks to previous games here, including a Monolith Burger location that you can get a job at putting burgers together. You’ll need to do this as you won’t have enough money (buckazoids) to buy the dress and wig you need to pass as one of the Amazons (who’s debit card you happened to pick up).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq4/scummvm-sq4-cd-00010.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The arcade sequence is pretty simple as you just add condiments to a burger on an assembly line. If you don’t screw up, you get 1 buckazoid per burger, but if you send 3 burgers to the finish line incorrectly you’ll be fired.</p>

<p>This is not hard - but it’s tedious. The assembly line gradually speeds up so it gets more challenging, but you can adjust the game speed to slow this down as needed.</p>

<p>I appreciate that the game gives you the option before you even begin to just take the money and skip the arcade sequence entirely - while still getting the money you need to progress.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq4/scummvm-sq4-cd-00009.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As a bit of a meta joke about the game, the puzzle design and the relative difficulty of Sierra games, one of the things you’ll need to buy at the mall is a Space Quest IV hint book. This is actually required to finish the game as there are two codes you’ll need that are only found in the hint book!</p>

<p>Honestly I thought this was pretty clever, and though only a couple of the hints are relevant, the other entries in the book that you reveal (with a magic pen) are typically pretty funny.</p>

<p>If you were a PC gamer in the early 90’s, you may have had one of Sierra’s hint books, so the fact that one of these existed in-game as well as <a href="https://www.sierragamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Space_Quest_4_Hint_Book.pdf">being available as a printed hint book</a> was <em>super meta</em>. It’s also funny how the printed hint book contains a clue as to how you need to use the in-game hint book to find partial coordinates for the time pod.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq4/scummvm-sq4-cd-00015.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Eventually the Sequel Police will find you in SQX, and you’ll steal their time pod and use the code you pieced together from the gum wrapper and the hint book to jump all the way back to Space Quest I (check out <a href="/blog/2021/08/09/space-quest-the-sarien-encounter/">my review of that game</a> if you’re curious).</p>

<p>Once again, make sure you write down the coordinates in the time pod as that’s what you’ll need to return to SQX later!</p>

<p>The SQ1 sequence is real short, but the bikers you meet (who are in black and white) make fun of you for being rendered in all that fancy 256 color glory.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq4/scummvm-sq4-cd-00018.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You’ll bounce around time periods a couple more times collecting items you’ll need for the final showdown with Vohaul. Like most Sierra games you’ll find yourself picking up anything that isn’t nailed down to try and solve the various in-game puzzles.</p>

<p>Unlike many Sierra games though, there really aren’t that many items to find in this game. If you forget to pick up the bunny, bottle and the slime at the very beginning of the game I’m pretty sure you’ll find yourself in an unwinnable situation, but otherwise you should be able to jump between time periods if you forgot anything.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq4/scummvm-sq4-cd-00021.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are plenty of ways for Roger to get himself killed, but unlike the last couple games in the series I didn’t really find there to be all that much variety in the messaging you get prior to a game over.</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean there aren’t <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Raa1ZMOLJ3s">some great death sequences</a>, but the majority of the death dialog windows are just a variation of Roger lying on his stomach.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq4/scummvm-sq4-cd-00003.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To be fair, we all remember the zombie screeching at us and then Roger dying, so it’s not like these were “bad”. My issue was more with the lack of variety compared to previous games.</p>

<p>Honestly I like spending a little extra time per screen to see what interactions result in my untimely demise, but I just didn’t really find the results all that entertaining this time around.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq4/scummvm-sq4-cd-00023.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The endgame sequence involves hacking into the main computer in Vohaul’s lair (which you use the in-game hint book to do), then deleting some subroutines (like the guard robots). If you happen to delete the SQIV “program”, the game will actually exit.</p>

<p>I thought this was pretty clever, though if you aren’t prepared for it and haven’t saved … well I guess that’s on you 🤣. There’s also a Leisure Suit Larry 4 icon there, which is yet another in joke for Sierra fans as that game never existed (read <a href="https://allowe.com/games/larry/inside-stories/wheres-lsl4.html">Al Lowe’s true story of why the series jumped from LSL3 to LSL5</a>).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq4/scummvm-sq4-cd-00024.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game end’s with you facing off against Sludge Vohaul, who has taken over your son’s body. Oh yeah, you have a son apparently because - you know - time travel and stuff.</p>

<p>This sequence is pretty simple as you just sort of move around and throw each other to the ground, and eventually Vohaul will throw a disk that you need to retrieve an put into the super computer so you can download your son’s consciousness and upload it back to his body to finish the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/sq4/scummvm-sq4-cd-00027.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As much as I love the Space Quest series, this entry is probably one of my least favourites. Visually it’s impressive, and the writing and voice acting is excellent - but the time travel elements are actually kind of frustrating.</p>

<p>First of all, I couldn’t read the keyboard in the time pod. I found myself using a screenshot that I blew up to like 400% to try and figure out which key corresponded to which symbol to try and enter the time codes. Since you have to backtrack a few times, you need to go through this rigamarole a few times as well and it just seemed excessive as a result.</p>

<p>Next, I didn’t really find the story to be all that interesting. I like time travel and sci-fi stories, but this felt underdeveloped and focusing a bit more on jokes for Sierra fans than plot progression.</p>

<p>Overall it’s not all that bad, but it’s also not really all that memorable.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@OneShortEye">OneShortEye</a>’s recent video about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db51SipYewo">How Speedrunners Broke Space Quest IV (again)</a> reignited my interest in this game, which ultimately resulted in this playthrough. If you’re into speed running I’d highly recommend his videos as he covers a lot of adventure games. As an aside, my site made a cameo appearance in his <a href="https://youtu.be/dSYnfLwGDRI?si=q0mHmSb9_OtgnUiG&amp;t=377">3 Obscure Easter Eggs in Sanitarium</a>, so might as well plug my <a href="/blog/2021/12/22/sanitarium/">Sanitarium review</a> 😅.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(video_game)">Normality</a> is a 3D graphic adventure, released in June 1996 by Gremlin Interactive. All cut-scenes in the game are pre-rendered. The game’s engine was later used in the game <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/1418/realms-of-the-haunting/">Realms of the Haunting</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/normality/norm_030.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Kent Knutson is a teenager who lives in the city of Neutropolis. The city is controlled by a totalitarian regime, which prohibits people to express any emotions that would deviate from the prescribed norm - such as joy and happiness. Kent is arrested by the Norms, the police force of Neutropolis, and put in prison for whistling a merry tune. In prison, he received an anonymous note that tells him that there is a resistance group somewhere in the city, which seeks to overthrow the dictator of Neutropolis. The question is - how can Kent find that resistance group?.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/normality/norm_001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>What sets this game apart from other adventure games of the era is that you’re navigating a 3D world with a first person perspective. This is what you’d expect from Doom or Duke Nukem 3D, but not a point and click title.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/normality/norm_000.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>For the first time in this series I’m in including an animated GIF just to show this off. As you navigate the game world you move around with the arrow keys and can pan up and down to see above or below you.</p>

<p>The game design incorporates these mechanics pretty frequently as you’ll occasionally find yourself unable to progress because the item you need is behind something, or it’s above you in a narrow space and you need to look up and reposition yourself to interact with something.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/normality/norm_028.png" alt="" />
<em>You need to navigate to the back of the room and look down while moving around the crate to see this mallet</em></p>

<p>Though the game world is presented in 3D, as you move around you also have a cursor you pan over the screen that will highlight things you can interact with. Clicking on an action area will bring up a “voodoo doll” that is basically a visual representation fo the verbs you can use to interact with the thing you’ve highlighted.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/normality/norm_005.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is not a unique mechanic and appears in a lot of adventure games at this time (such as <a href="/blog/2023/03/10/full-throttle/">Full Throttle</a>). Once you bring up the voodoo doll (that’s what they call it in the <a href="https://www.starehry.eu/download/adventure/docs/Normality-Manual.pdf">manual</a>), moving the mouse cursor over the various verbs will animate them slightly so you know what you’re about to select.</p>

<p>The options are limited to the usual suspects of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">USE</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OPEN</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TALK</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/normality/norm_014.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The story progresses through various interactions with NPCs, which involves navigating basic dialog trees. There’s really nothing innovative here, though the US release of the game has Kent voiced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Feldman">Corey Feldman</a> which adds a nice nostalgic flair to the experience.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/normality/norm_013.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Aside from character interactions, the story also progresses through various pre-rendered cutscenes. These all have a very “90s” feel to them and though dated by today’s standards definitely don’t feel out of place in this game world.</p>

<p>These animated sequences occur pretty often, so the pace of the game is pretty consistently maintained. You’ll find yourself moving around each game scene, hovering the cursor over everything to see what you’re able to interact with, trying all available verbs to see what works then frequently being rewarded with an animation if you picked correctly.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/normality/norm_004.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>A large portion of this game involves fetch quests and item combination puzzles. Maybe this is just an artifact of when this game came out, but I had a lot of trouble making progress without resorting to a walkthrough as a number of puzzles were a bit obtuse.</p>

<p>This could just be due to me being too impatient, but I found myself just randomly clicking each item on every other item more than once to try and make some progress when I’d get stuck.</p>

<p>I’m assuming the developers may have expected players to get stuck as the manual has hints for most of the game’s main areas!</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/normality/norm_007.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You have access to a map (press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M</code> to access it) which opens up various game locations as you progress. If you don’t know about this then once you get out of the apartment you’re imprisoned in initially you won’t be able to progress with the game (yes, I got stuck like that at first).</p>

<p>Typically you’re just jumping between the various locations picking up items you may need to solve puzzles.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/normality/norm_010.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There aren’t all that many characters to interact with, but they will typically help move you in the right direction by giving plot detail or objectives.</p>

<p>As you progress, the game’s goofy soundtrack is playing in the background which enhances the mood appropriately. This whole game just sort of feels like you’re playing through an episode of a Saturday morning cartoon of that era - which isn’t a bad thing.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/normality/norm_031.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After solving a bunch of weird puzzles you’ll eventually find yourself underneath the stadium, which is a huge maze. This section can be a bit frustrating as you’ll first need to figure out how to get batteries for the night vision goggles - which involves stumbling around the maze in the dark for a while.</p>

<p>This final sequence just didn’t make a lot of sense, but it is weird and confusing in a way that is fitting to this title. You’ll end up finding Saul’s brain, which you need to bring up on stage in the stadium so that it can somehow change Paul’s thinking and free Neutropolis from his evil reign … or something like that.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/normality/norm_033.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I honestly had a lot of fun with this game, though it can be frustrating at times. I really appreciated a different approach to this genre through a 3D game world, and the story was definitely swinging for the fences in trying to present a unique experience.</p>

<p>There’s a great writeup by <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2023/01/normality/">The Digital Antiquarian</a> that goes into a lot more detail about this game that I’d highly recommend if you find this interesting.</p>

<p>Since I haven’t covered another title like this yet, and it presented a new take on the genre I think this one is worth checking out.</p>

Though this information is readily available and extremely helpful, what it lacks is a high level overview to tie the specs together into a cohesive picture of what a MongoDB driver is.</p>

<p>Architecturally an implicit hierarchy exists within the drivers, so expressing drivers in terms of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_model">onion model</a> feels appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="layers-of-the-onion">Layers of the Onion</h2>

<p><img src="/images/drivers-onion.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The <em>“drivers onion”</em> is meant to represent how various concepts, components and APIs can be layered atop each other to build a MongoDB driver from the ground up, or to help understand how existing drivers have been structured. Hopefully this representation of MongoDB’s drivers helps provide some clarity, as the complexity of these libraries - like the onion above - could otherwise bring you to tears.</p>

<h3 id="serialization">Serialization</h3>

<p>At their lowest level all MongoDB drivers will need to know how to work with <a href="https://bsonspec.org/">BSON</a>. BSON (short for “Binary JSON”) is a bin­ary-en­coded serialization of <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a>-like documents, and like JSON, it sup­ports the nesting of arrays and documents. BSON also contains extensions that al­low representation of data types that are not part of the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7159">JSON spec</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="prompt-tip">

</blockquote>

<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>

<p>Once BSON documents can be created and manipulated, the foundation for interacting with a MongoDB host process has been laid. Drivers communicate by sending <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/">database commands</a> as serialized BSON documents using MongoDB’s <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mongodb-wire-protocol/">wire protocol</a>.</p>

<p>From the provided connection string and options a socket connection is established to a host, which an initial handshake verifies is in fact a valid MongoDB connection by sending a simple <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/hello/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello</code></a>. Based on the response to this first command a driver can continue to establish and authenticate connections.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h3>

<p>Now that a valid host has been found, the cluster’s topology can be discovered and monitoring connections can be established. Connection pools can then be created and populated with connections. The monitoring connections will subsequently be used for ensuring operations are routed to available hosts, or hosts that meet certain criteria (such as a configured <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/upcoming/core/read-preference/">read preference</a> or acceptable latency window).</p>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3>

<p>Establishing and monitoring connections to MongoDB ensures they’re available, but MongoDB server processes typically will require the connection to be <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/authentication/">authenticated</a> before commands will be accepted. MongoDB offers many authentication mechanisms such as <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/security-scram">SCRAM</a>, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/security-x.509/">x.509</a>, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/kerberos/">Kerberos</a>, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/security-ldap/">LDAP</a>, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/security-oidc/">OpenID Connect</a> and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security/passwordless-authentication/">AWS IAM</a>, which MongoDB drivers support using the <em><a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4422.txt">Simple Authentication and Security Layer</a></em> (SASL) framework.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="availability">Availability</h3>

<p>All client operations will be serialized as BSON and sent to MongoDB over a connection that will first be checked out of a connection pool. Various monitoring processes exist to ensure a driver’s internal state machine contains an accurate view of the cluster’s topology so that read and write requests can always be appropriately routed according to MongoDB’s <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/read-preference-mechanics/">server selection algorithm</a>.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="resilience">Resilience</h3>

<p>At their core, database drivers are client libraries meant to facilitate interactions between an application and the database. MongoDB’s drivers are no different in that regard, as they abstract away the underlying serialization, communication, connectivity, and availability functions required to programmatically interact with your data.</p>

<p>To further enhance the developer experience while working with MongoDB, various resilience features can be added based on <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/server-sessions/">logical sessions</a> such as <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/retryable-writes">retryable writes</a>, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/read-isolation-consistency-recency/#std-label-causal-consistency">causal consistency</a>, and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/transactions/">transactions</a>.</p>

<h3 id="programmability">Programmability</h3>

<p>Now that we can serialize commands and send them over the wire through an authenticated connection we can begin actually manipulating data. Since all database interactions are in the form of commands, if we wanted to remove a single document we might issue a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/delete"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">delete</code> command</a> such as the following:</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
3

</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre><span class="nx">db</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">runCommand</span><span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
     <span class="na">delete</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">orders</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span>
     <span class="na">deletes</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="na">q</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="na">status</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">D</span><span class="dl">"</span> <span class="p">},</span> <span class="na">limit</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">]</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Though not exceedingly complex, a better developer experience can be achieved through more single-purpose APIs. This would allow the above example to be expressed as:</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre><span class="nx">db</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">orders</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">deleteMany</span><span class="p">({</span> <span class="na">status</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">D</span><span class="dl">"</span> <span class="p">})</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>To provide a cleaner and clearer developer experience, many specifications exist to describe how these APIs should be consistently presented across driver implementations, while still providing the flexibility to make APIs more idiomatic for each language.</p>

<p>Advanced security features such as <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/csfle/">client-side field level encryption</a> are also defined at this layer.</p>

<h3 id="observability">Observability</h3>

<p>With database commands being serialized and sent to MongoDB servers and responses being received and deserialized, our driver can be considered fully functional for most read and write operations. As MongoDB drivers abstract away most of the complexity involved with creating and maintaining the connections these commands will be sent over, providing mechanisms for introspection into a driver’s functionality can provide developers with added confidence that things are working as expected.</p>

<p>The inner workings of connection pools, connection lifecycle, server monitoring, topology changes, command execution and other driver components are exposed by means of events developers can register listeners to capture. This can be an invaluable troubleshooting tool and can help facilitate monitoring the health of an application.</p>

<p>Given the example above (using the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/">Node.js driver</a>) the specified connection events and command events would be logged as they’re emitted by the driver:</p>

<p><code>connectionCheckedOut: {"time":{"$date":"2024-05-17T15:18:18.589Z"},"address":"localhost:27018","name":"connectionCheckedOut","connectionId":1}</code><br />
<code>commandStarted: {"name":"commandStarted","address":"127.0.0.1:27018","connectionId":1,"serviceId":null,"requestId":5,"databaseName":"test","commandName":"find","command":{"find":"foo","filter":{},"limit":1,"singleBatch":true,"batchSize":1,"lsid":{"id":{"$binary":{"base64":"4B1kOPCGRUe/641MKhGT4Q==","subType":"04"}}},"$clusterTime":{"clusterTime":{"$timestamp":{"t":1715959097,"i":1}},"signature":{"hash":{"$binary":"base64":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=","subType":"00"}},"keyId":0}},"$db":"test"},"serverConnectionId":140}</code></p>

<p>The preferred method of observing internal behavior would be through <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/logging/logging.md">standardized logging</a> once it is available in all drivers (<a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DRIVERS-1204">DRIVERS-1204</a>), however until that time only event logging is consistently available. In the future additional observability tooling such as <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/">Open Telemetry</a> support may also be introduced.</p>

<h3 id="testability">Testability</h3>

<p>Ensuring existing as well as net-new drivers can be effectively tested for correctness and performance, most specifications define a standard set of tests using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930061614/https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/cat-herds-crook-yaml-test-specs-improve-driver-conformance">YAML tests to improve driver conformance</a>. This allows specification authors and maintainers to describe functionality once with the confidence that the tests can be executed alike by language-specific test runners across all drivers.</p>

<p>Though the unified test format greatly simplifies language-specific implementations, not all tests can be represented in this fashion. In those cases the specifications may describe tests to be manually implemented as prose. By limiting the number of prose tests that each driver must implement, engineers can deliver functionality with greater confidence while also minimizing the burden of upstream verification.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Most (if not all) the information required to build a new driver or maintain existing drivers technically exists within the specifications, however without a mental mode of their composition and architecture it can be extremely challenging to know where to look.</p>

<p>Peeling the <em>“drivers onion”</em> should hopefully make reasoning about them a little easier, especially with the understanding that everything can be tested to validate individual implementations are “up to spec”.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="MongoDB" /><category term="mongodb" /><category term="drivers" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The modern MongoDB driver consists of a number of components, each of which are thoroughly documented in the Specifications repository.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_II,_Whodunit%3F">Hugo II, Whodunit?</a> (named Hugo’s Mystery Adventure in the Hugo Trilogy re-release) is a parser-based adventure game designed by independent software developer David P. Gray and published as shareware by Gray Design Associates in 1991. It is the sequel to 1990’s <a href="/blog/2022/12/21/hugos-house-of-horrors/">Hugo’s House of Horrors</a>, and it was followed by Hugo III, Jungle of Doom! in 1992.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hugo2/scummvm-hugo2-00014.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Hugo and his wife, Penelope, arrive to stay at the mansion that belongs to Hugo’s Great Uncle Horace. Penelope falls asleep in the bedroom, while Hugo accidentally finds a bookcase passage and is locked in a secret room. Penelope wakes up, only to witness Uncle Horace’s murder through the keyhole. The player controls Penelope (and later, briefly, Hugo) and must solve the murder.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hugo2/scummvm-hugo2-00001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This title improves slightly on the original as moving the mouse around the screen will occasionally highlight character or object names. This is a cue as to something you should type into the text parser to interact with (ex: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK BOOKCASE</code>).</p>

<p>Once you lie down and Hugo disappears, you’ll gain control of Penelope - who is the main character on this adventure.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hugo2/scummvm-hugo2-00007.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you work your way through the Uncle Horace’s property you’ll meet a couple NPCs that you can interact with. These interactions are extremely limited (they’re not dialogue trees) and typically don’t advance the plot - they just serve as puzzles as you typically need them to move so you can progress.</p>

<p>Since I’m playing this game in ScummVM, the original text boxes have been replaced by UI modals - which IMHO look awful. Apparently a “nice to have” on the <a href="https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Hugo/TODO">Hugo/TODO</a> page is implementing the original dialog boxes … so maybe one day.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hugo2/scummvm-hugo2-00010.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In a couple areas you need to navigate the screen using almost pixel-perfect navigation to either keep yourself from dying, or getting into an unwinnable situation.</p>

<p>The venus fly trap screen requires you to walk through a “maze” in order to get a magnifying glass. The hit boxes for these plants are massive though, so you’ll die <em>many times</em> trying to get through this.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hugo2/scummvm-hugo2-00011.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When you get past the venus fly traps you’ll need to cross a bridge, but if you accidentally touch the “edges” of the walkable area you’ll drop your matches and they’ll get wet.</p>

<p>If this happens, you won’t be able to light a stick of dynamite later in the game.</p>

<p>Luckily this game is very short, so if you happen to get yourself into this situation it’s really only a matter of backtracking about 30 minutes of play time to get yourself to that point from an earlier save.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hugo2/scummvm-hugo2-00013.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To progress through the mid-portion of the game you need to press various buttons in the shed to trigger certain events. These can’t be done until you first walk all the way to the screen where the event will occur, then walk back and press the button.</p>

<p>For example, you can’t turn on the bug light to attract the bees until you’ve “been there” once.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hugo2/scummvm-hugo2-00009.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Since you’ll be doing a lot of backtracking it is appreciated that this game has a “Turbo” mode that makes Penelope walk twice as fast.</p>

<p>This is especially helpful when you have to navigate through the hedge maze (oh goody … a maze). Thankfully this isn’t all that big and is easy enough to map out, but given the limited colour palette of this game this section is a little hard on the eyes.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hugo2/scummvm-hugo2-00018.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The maze exists to hide a couple items you’ll need to collect to proceed - which honestly sums up most of this game. A good portion of the game’s screens contain items that you’ll need to use exactly once to solve a single puzzle.</p>

<p>This is fairly simplistic game design, but I can’t fault David P. Gray as he single handedly wrote a trilogy of games that he even <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/759580011285484/">went into technical detail about</a> for anyone that was interested.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hugo2/scummvm-hugo2-00017.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To add some flavour there are timing-based puzzles as well. For example, if you place and light the dynamite you have a fixed amount of time to get out of the well before it explodes and kills you.</p>

<p>Though there aren’t many game over scenarios, they are possible so it’s worth saving every few screens just so you don’t have to backtrack too far when you mess up.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hugo2/scummvm-hugo2-00015.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The narrative of this game is a little disjointed, like when you step into a phone booth, call a number you just saw written in graffiti and meet Dr. Who (sort of).</p>

<p>It’s all to give you a screwdriver you can use to open a safe a few screens later, but there’s no rhyme or reason for this encounter.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hugo2/scummvm-hugo2-00021.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you make your way back into the mansion you’ll talk to family members who you’ll get clues from as to what happened to Uncle Horace. Finally you’ll all gather in a room with a police officer who asks you “Whodunit?!?”.</p>

<p>If you guess right (that nobody murdered Horace) you get points, otherwise Cousin Harry gives you a little info and we meet back up with Hugo, who is locked in a closet.</p>

<p>The solution to get out of the closet is fairly straightforward. Once you put the newspaper under the door, poke the key out of the keyhole so it falls and you pull it under the door on the newspaper, you get out and it’s game over.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/hugo2/scummvm-hugo2-00022.png" alt="" />
<em>And that’s a wrap</em></p>

<p>Though it improves on the previous entry in the series, Hugo 2 is extremely simplistic. The graphics are simple, the audio is PC speaker beeps and there’s typically no music (aside from a couple of screens).</p>

<p>The game is very straightforward aside from a couple of slightly obtuse puzzles such as rubbing catnip on a bell, then giving the bell to the cat so he’ll ring it and distract the maid while you’re in another room.</p>

<p>Hugo games really feel like they’re a variation of Sierra’s AGI games, but not nearly as robust. For a game written and developed by one guy though, it really isn’t all that bad.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Ruby allows a developer to specify a <em>finalizer</em> proc for an object. This proc is called after an object was destroyed. This is a very useful mechanism that can be used for some cleanup when the object is gone. However, it turned out that there are limitations to what you can do inside finalizers. And these limitations are the same as ones for a signal trap. So, if you write a finalizer, you should follow the <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/master/doc/signals.rdoc">documentation for signal traps</a>.</p>

<p>Some time ago a user opened an issue in our bug tracker. In his logs he noticed an exception raised by the MongoDB Ruby driver:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>`synchronize': can't be called from trap context (ThreadError)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>From the logs, we could see that the exception was raised when calling synchronize on a mutex inside the finalizer. However, the exception says that synchronize can’t be called from a “trap context”. What is that, and how is it related to our finalizers?</p>

<p>Finalizer is a proc that will be called when a specific object is about to be destroyed by garbage collection. In the MongoDB Ruby driver, we use finalizers to close unused cursors. A cursor is returned in response to a query and can be iterated to retrieve results. Cursors are a very convenient mechanism; however, cursors are server-side objects, and every cursor consumes server memory. Therefore, it is a good idea to let the server know if a cursor is unused so that the resources are released. So, if an object that represents a cursor is destroyed, the cursor is definitely unused and can be closed.</p>

<p>Below is a very simplified example of how this can be done:</p>

<p>We can ask Ruby to do the garbage collection by calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GC.start</code>, so we can test the code.</p>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>So far so good. Of course, this solution is far from ideal. Here we send a command to the server every time the finalizer is called. First, this will block the main thread. Further, it will issue one command per cursor, which is not ideal. We can also reduce the number of commands we send by killing all cursors for a collection in one command. So, we came up with an idea for the cursor reaper — a background thread that wakes up from time to time and kills unused cursors:</p>

<p>Note that there is a mutex in the CursorReaper class. The kill_cursors method of the reaper will be called in a background thread, hence the locking. Let’s test it:</p>

<p>Still, no error, even though the latter example calls synchronize inside the finalizer. What is the difference between the example and the real-world situation? In the example, we trigger garbage collection manually. Normally this is triggered by Ruby itself. What if we create so many objects that Ruby actually starts the GC?</p>

<p>Yes, this code actually reproduces the problem, and the exception is raised! So, it looks like finalizers are executed inside a signal trap. Therefore, to fix the problem we should just <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/master/doc/signals.rdoc">follow the documentation</a> and not use operations that are not allowed inside the traps. In our case with the cursor reaper, we got rid of mutexes in finalizers by using a queue data structure, and the bug was fixed.</p>

<h2 id="we-need-to-go-deeper">We Need to Go Deeper</h2>

<p>Even though the problem was gone, I decided to find out whether finalizers are really executed inside a signal trap. I though maybe Ruby VM uses signals internally to trigger garbage collection. I could not find any mentions about such a usage of signals, so I had to read Ruby source code. It tuned out to be fun, and the outcome was very unexpected!</p>

<p>I started by finding where the error <em>“can’t be called from trap context”</em> is raised. I found it in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">do_mutex_lock</code> function inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">thread_sync.c</code> file:</p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

3

  <span class="n">th</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">ec</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">interrupt_mask</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">TRAP_INTERRUPT_MASK</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">rb_raise</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rb_eThreadError</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"can't be called from trap context"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, what is actually verified is whether the execution context has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TRAP_INTERRUPT_MASK</code> flag set. This flag is set in three functions: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rb_postponed_job_flush</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vm_trace.c</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rb_threadptr_execute_interrupts</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">thread.c</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">signal_exec</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">signal.c</code>. After some debugging, I found out that in our case the flag is set in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rb_postponed_job_flush</code> function. Actually, this is also confirmed by this comment for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rb_gc</code> function in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gc.h</code>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>* Finalisers are deferred until we can handle interrupts. See * `rb_postponed_job_flush` in vm_trace.c.
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Alright, now it is more or less clear what is going on. Finalizers are not executed immediately after an object is “garbage collected”. Instead, a postponed job is created and scheduled. Such jobs are executed in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rb_postponed_job_flush</code> function. This function sets the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TRAP_INTERRUPT_MASK</code> flag, which is later checked by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">do_mutex_lock</code>. Hence the error. I even found <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/05459d1a33db59c47e98e327c9f52808ebc76a3f">the commit</a> that introduces the current behavior, and <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/10595">a bug</a> that was fixed by this commit. It looks like the Ruby team wanted to make sure that finalizers are never interrupted by a signal; as a side effect, code inside finalizers is treated as code inside a signal trap.</p>

<p><em>To summarize, finalizers are <strong>not</strong> executed inside a signal trap; however, Ruby applies the same restrictions to signal traps and finalizers. This is not documented anywhere; further, the exception raised is a bit misleading. Be careful!</em></p>

<p>P.S. It is still unclear why we did not see the exception when we trigger the garbage collection manually. I wasn’t able to find the answer; maybe this is a topic for my next article.</p>]]></content><author><name>Dmitry Rybakov</name></author><category term="Programming" /><category term="ruby" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reposted from Dmitry’s blog.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_of_Monkey_Island">The Secret of Monkey Island</a> is a 1990 point-and-click graphic adventure game developed and published by Lucasfilm Games.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mi1/scummvm-monkey-00001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Deep in the Caribbean lies Melee Island, ruled by the governor Elaine Marley. The cruel pirate LeChuck is deeply in love with her - so deeply that he refuses to accept his own death. As a ghost, he dwells with his undead crew somewhere near the mysterious Monkey Island. Meanwhile, a young fellow named Guybrush Threepwood is determined to become a real pirate. At the Scumm Bar, he meets three pirates who tell him he has to complete three difficult tasks in order to be worthy of this title. But as Guybrush is trying to complete these tasks, he encounters the lovely governor, and this meeting changes his life forever. Risking to incur the wrath of LeChuck, Guybrush has to prove his wit is as sharp as his sword, and figure out a way to foil the ghost pirate’s plans.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mi1/scummvm-monkey-00007.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Without pulling any punches I might as well just start off with the fact that this is possibly one of the best adventure games of all time. From the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdd2CNlcqn0">amazing soundtrack</a> and excellent pixel art to the captivating story and the extremely forgiving game play, Secret of Monkey Island is extremely welcoming to anyone looking to get started with this genre of game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mi1/scummvm-monkey-00031.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Being an early SCUMM game you’re presented with a very familiar screen layout with the main view on top, a verb list in the lower left and inventory in the lower right. Moving the mouse cursor around the screen will call out any action areas you can interact with, and based on which verb is selected, you can perform said action on whatever you just clicked on.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mi1/scummvm-monkey-00012.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you progress on your quest to become a mighty pirate, you’ll find yourself picking up a lot of items. As a result, most puzzles in this game involve either completing fetch quests, or item combination puzzles.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mi1/scummvm-monkey-00014.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game typically points you in the right direction as to what you need to do next, which item you need or how things need to be combined so though it can be challenging at times, I never found the game to get frustrating.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mi1/scummvm-monkey-00006.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Most characters in the game can be engaged with, opening up a conversation system with branching dialogue options. There are typically a number of nonsense options in each conversation that will are just a distraction, but the writing in this game is so good (and funny) that it’s almost worth exploring these even if you know you’re picking the “wrong” option.</p>

<p>Graphically this game is top notch, as can be seen in character portraits and background artwork. As a result you’re typically not just sweeping your cursor around the screen hoping to find some magic pixel to interact with - the detail of the backgrounds make whatever thing you’re supposed to interact with pretty apparent.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mi1/scummvm-monkey-00019.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Secret of Monkey Island introduces a unique battle mechanic, which is actually weirdly intuitive and easy to learn. One of the quests you need to embark on is to defeat the legendary swordmaster, but to do this you’ll need to build up a repertoire of insults.</p>

<p>“Battles” consist of you hurling an insult, and the other pirate either having a witty comeback or a generic comment (ex: “I am rubber you are glue”). If they have a comeback, they win a round and can insult you, and you need to “defend” with a comeback. If a pirate uses an insult in battle you haven’t learned, it’s added to your list of insults for future battles - as are the comebacks pirates have used.</p>

<p>If you match a comeback to an insult, you’ll win a round, and if you win 3 or 4 rounds you win the fight.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mi1/scummvm-monkey-00021.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Eventually you’ll build up enough insults to challenge (and hopefully defeat) the legendary swordmaster. This is actually pretty interesting as she’ll lob insults you’ve never heard before but you can still successfully parry with comebacks you’ve already learned - assuming you pick the right ones.</p>

<p>This is just another example of how well this game is written, as so much care was put into crafting this battle system that they wrote multiple insults that would make sense (and sort of be funny) with the same comebacks.</p>

<p>I personally loved this game mechanic and am impressed it wasn’t overplayed. They really only use it in the lead up to the swordmaster fight - then never again. With such a unique element to the game it may have been tempting to overplay it, but you gotta give the designers credit for fighting that urge and making a really well balanced game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mi1/scummvm-monkey-00022.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game is split into three main chapters, two of which take place on islands you can navigate from an overhead map view. This makes each area feel a lot bigger than it actually is, as there are typically a handful of actual locations to visit.</p>

<p>These locations are called out as you move your cursor over them, and clicking on them will make Guybrush walk there. In chapter 3 you eventually get access to a boat, which moves extremely slowly, but if you double click an area of the screen that’s further away from you he paddles quickly and the boat moves a lot faster.</p>

<p>I appreciated this type of optimization in the game as it can be tedious waiting for the character to slowly progress on the map just to give an area a false sense of scale.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mi1/scummvm-monkey-00030.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As the story progresses you’ll prove yourself to be a mighty pirate, meet the governor, fall for her and then have to go rescue her once the Ghost Pirate LeChuck kidnaps her. This is done by recruiting a crew and buying a boat, but once you do this crew sort of abandons you to instead soak up some rays on the deck.</p>

<p>The bulk of this second chapter consists of you completing a massive item combination puzzle as the directions to Monkey Island are presented to you in the form of a recipe.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mi1/scummvm-monkey-00032.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Everything you’ll need to get to the island are on the ship, so this giant fetch quest just involves searching the ship, picking up items, referring to the recipe (once you find it) to see what should get thrown in the pot - then throwing it in the pot.</p>

<p>Once the recipe is complete everyone on the ship falls asleep and you wake up off the shore of Monkey Island. How convenient!</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mi1/scummvm-monkey-00036.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you find Monkey Island you’ll need to get yourself there, but you don’t seem to have a rowboat. Good thing you learning how to fire yourself out of a cannon earlier in the game.</p>

<p>To me at least this was an example of good puzzle design, as you’d already learned how cannons could be used, and you happen to have a long piece of rope, embers from a fire, gunpowder and a pot you can use as a helmet …</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mi1/scummvm-monkey-00037.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are only a few characters to meet on the island once you get there, but they drop some hints as to where LeChuck is and what they need from you. After embarking on another series of fetch quests, you’ll eventually get the key to enter the underground where LeChuck’s ghost ship is anchored.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mi1/scummvm-monkey-00042.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>From the ghost ship you retrieve the root and give it back to the cannibals so they can make you som root beer you can use to get rid of ghosts. When you bring the root back, the cannibals prepare the root beer, you return to the ghost ship and find out you just missed them.</p>

<p>LeChunk has taken Governor Marley back to Melee Island to marry her. Instead of having to manually backtrack, your crew appears at this point and after a brief cutscene you automatically return to Melee Island with them.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mi1/scummvm-monkey-00044.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The final showdown with Lechuck is pretty easy, though you need to move quickly or he’ll punch you off screen and delay the fight. It’s kind of funny that you make it this far with the magic root beer, you go to use it on LeChuck and it gets jammed on some pocket lint.</p>

<p>Eventually you’ll grab a can of grog, spray LeChuck with it and the game will be over.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mi1/scummvm-monkey-00045.png" alt="" />
<em>The End</em></p>

<p>I basically loved everything about this game. The writing was fantastic, the story was compelling, the puzzles were challenging but intuitive, the music was great, it’s visually appealing and the dialogue was engaging. If you’re already a fan of this game, I’d encourage you to go read the Video Game History Foundation’s <a href="https://gamehistory.org/monkeyisland/">30th anniversary of Monkey Island</a> article as it contains lots of development details and insights.</p>

<p>There are 2 sequels to this game that I plan on playing for this series, and I am really looking forward to getting to those. I know there’s a fourth game, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_from_Monkey_Island">Escape from Monkey Island</a> came out in 2000 so is just outside the range I set - though I might circle back to it one day just for fun.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mi1/scummvm-monkey-00047.png" alt="" />
<em>The only game over in this game</em></p>

<p>Though this is a LucasArts game, there is exactly one game over screen in The Secret of Monkey Island, and it’s a bit of an easter egg. Right from the beginning of the game Guybrush mentions his talent is holding his breath for 10 minutes - which is something you’ll leverage at one point when you’re thrown in the ocean to drown.</p>

<p>You can easily just walk out of the water and escape certain death, but if you just let the game idle for more than 10 minutes, Guybrush will die. Unlike Sierra games of this era, instead of prompting you with a game over screen, the verb list changes to represent your new set of options.</p>

<p>This is just another example of the clever game design, excellent writing and underlying humor that permeates this title through and through. I would highly recommend this game to anyone - whether they’re a fan of the genre or not.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Quest:_Open_Season">Police Quest: Open Season</a> (also known as Police Quest IV) is a 1993 police procedural point-and-click adventure video game developed and published by Sierra On-Line that follows homicide detective John Carey as he investigates a series of brutal murders in Los Angeles.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq4/scummvm-pq4-cd-00023.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This fourth installment in the Police Quest series abandons the story arc of the previous three games, introducing a new setting and a new protagonist. The story begins with detective John Carey finding his best friend and ex-partner, Officer Bob Hickman, murdered in an alley in the Southern part of the city. An eight-year-old boy named Bobby Washington has been murdered as well. Carey begins an investigation that leads him deep into the criminal life of the city and a hunt for a maniacal murderer.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq4/scummvm-pq4-cd-00028.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Growing up playing Sierra games, Police Quest was at the top of my list so I have very fond memories of the series. As I started on this review journey, I found myself playing through the first three games (<a href="/blog/2022/03/15/police-quest-1/">Police Quest: In Pursuit of the Death Angel</a>, <a href="/blog/2023/02/21/police-quest-2/">Police Quest II: The Vengeance</a>, <a href="/blog/2023/12/16/police-quest-iii/">Police Quest III: The Kindred</a>) pretty early on as I was looking forward to getting reacquainted with Sonny Bonds and the city of Lytton.</p>

<p>This entry in the series throws all that legacy out the window and instead tries to present a grittier, more realistic setting.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq4/scummvm-pq4-cd-00017.png" alt="" />
<em>The graphics are blocky and just overall look shitty</em></p>

<p>What really struck me immediately is how bad this game looks. The character models are extremely chunky and looked overly compressed. Character walk cycle animations are rigid and awkward and everything in general just looks out of focus and kind of blurry.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq4/scummvm-pq4-cd-00034.png" alt="" />
<em>The text boxes can be extremely hard to read</em></p>

<p>Whenever you interact with another character in the game you’re presented with a translucent text box that makes it extremely difficult to read the contents. Since this is an adventure game that involves talking to a lot of characters to uncover plot points and advance the story, you’ll find yourself frequently in situations that involve squinting to try and make out what’s on screen.</p>

<p>All interactions are fully voice acted (including Detective Carey’s observations when you interact with the background) so you can get around the text box quality, but then you’re at the mercy of some sub-par voice acting instead. Not all voice acting is awful in this game, but it’s definitely not one of this game’s strengths.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq4/scummvm-pq4-cd-00044.png" alt="" />
<em>I’m sure this was meant to be an attempt at humor, but it feels forced</em></p>

<p>Unlike the voice acting, the background music is … fine. Nothing really notable other than it seems they reused a Leisure Suit Larry song for the elevator music which is a nice tip of the hat to fans of the series.</p>

<p>The tone of the game is a bit scattered. The subject matter is meant to be extremely serious, but they try to weave goofier elements in periodically. These attempts at comedy, mostly fell short for me and just came off as awkward and out of place.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq4/scummvm-pq4-cd-00037.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You advance through each day of this game by going to various locations across Los Angeles, interrogating various characters, collecting evidence and recording details using your notebook. Since this is another police procedure simulation you get points for following proper protocol.</p>

<p>This involves showing your badge to literally everyone you have to talk to (sometimes every single time you see them), clipping your name tag on every time you enter headquarters and filling out a form 3.14 <em>every single time you progress your investigation the tiniest bit</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq4/scummvm-pq4-cd-00022.png" alt="" />
<em>I HATE form 3.14</em></p>

<p>I know this is meant to be an “accurate simulation”, but this is just not fun game design. If you need to do this once - fine. If you need to do this every time it’s no longer a game - it’s just “work”.</p>

<p>A lot of this game just feels like work. Maybe that’s an accurate depiction of police detective work in the early 90s, but it really doesn’t translate to a compelling game experience.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq4/scummvm-pq4-cd-00041.png" alt="" />
<em>Point and click to navigate between game areas</em></p>

<p>I appreciate that you can fast travel to the various locations you need to investigate. In earlier entries in this series you would have to manually drive yourself around town, which could take forever and result in unnecessary game ending situations.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq4/scummvm-pq4-cd-00021.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Speaking of “game ending situations”, seeing as this is a Sierra game you would expect death to be lurking around every corner - but that’s just not the case. There are maybe a handful of situations that will trigger a game over, but these are few and far between.</p>

<p>What’s worse is the prompt you get when you die is just as boring as the rest of the game. I used to go out of my way to see how the game would describe my character’s death in games like Leisure Suit Larry or Space Quest because it was always funny, descriptive and entertaining.</p>

<p>The plain gray box with a generic message stating I died is fitting for how boring this game is as a whole.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq4/scummvm-pq4-cd-00032.png" alt="" />
<em>I got stuck here for a while</em></p>

<p>Open Season is not a very long game, but I found myself stuck and unable to progress at one point because a scripted event just would not trigger. After watching the news at the bar after the second day, the screen would just go blank and the game would wait forever. Eventually I found that lowering the detail and speed in the game settings before entering this sequence would allow the script to progress.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq4/scummvm-pq4-cd-00043.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game takes place over the course of a few days. If you don’t complete <em>everything</em>, the scripted events required to trigger the transition to the next day won’t trigger.</p>

<p>I found myself in a situation where I couldn’t get Wednesday to end, which it turned out was actually a pretty common issue for a lot of gamers. The official spoiler from Sierra Help states that you need to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Go to the L.A. County Morgue. You should see a news team questioning Sherry and the day will end. If this doesn’t happen, you have missed something. Did you get the newspaper clipping from the patrol car at the Impound Lot? Did you look at the clipping in your inventory? Did you go to the Bitty Kitty and question Electra and Barbie after showing them your badge? Did you show them both the shoe from Yo Money’s house? Did you question the proprietor of Ragin’ Records about the patrol car and the abandoned car? Did you give the bone from Griffith Park to the coroner?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Turns out I didn’t show Barbie the shoe. After doing this I went back to the coroner’s office and the script triggered that had the reporter pestering the coroner’s assistant.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq4/scummvm-pq4-cd-00045.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You’ll pick up a lot of items throughout the game, and thankfully their usage is typically pretty obvious. There are very few item combination puzzles, but the mirror-based one is a pain in the ass.</p>

<p>Near the end of the game you’ll need to peer around a corner to make sure a dog isn’t there, which you do by gluing a broken side-view mirror to a drumstick. This is not very obvious, but adventure game veterans know to just try combining everything with everything so once you put the glue on the drumstick and it works it sort of “clicks” that this will be a 3 way item combo puzzle.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq4/scummvm-pq4-cd-00013.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is an extremely repetitive game but the shooting range sequence is a neat distraction. Unfortunately this mechanic isn’t actually used anywhere in the game. You just sort of do this to kill time.</p>

<p>You do draw your gun a few times to make arrests, and there is a shotgun sequence at one point but the first person view of the shooting range doesn’t make an appearance anywhere else.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq4/scummvm-pq4-cd-00048.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The story progresses and you eventually uncover that there’s a cross dressing man killing people for … reasons? I don’t know if this wasn’t actually explained or if I just zoned out for the last couple days worth of content in this game but I never fully understood the motivations of the killer or why it was even all that material to the story as a whole.</p>

<p>You’ll ultimately find the killer then neutralize them by spraying them in the face with a home made flamethrower. Then you get a medal of valor for being awesome at your job. Way to go Detective Carey - you’re my hero.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/pq4/scummvm-pq4-cd-00049.png" alt="" />
<em>The End</em></p>

<p>Sierra should have left this series alone after Police Quest 3. I guess after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Walls">Jim Walls</a> left to join Tsunami Media (where he made <a href="/blog/2022/03/31/blue-force/">Blue Force</a>) they wanted to keep the series alive so they brought on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_Gates">Daryl F. Gates</a> to fill the void.</p>

<p>That void should have remained unfilled. Gates also consulted on Sierra’s SWAT series, which I equally didn’t enjoy playing …</p>

<p>I don’t recommend this game. Go back and play any of PQ 1 through 3 instead.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lure_of_the_Temptress">Lure of the Temptress</a> is a point-and-click adventure game published by Virgin Interactive Entertainment in June 1992 for Atari ST, MS-DOS, and Amiga. It was the first game developed by Revolution Software and uses their proprietary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Theatre">Virtual Theatre</a> engine.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lure/scummvm-lure-1-00010.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The medieval town of Turnvale has fallen into the hands of the evil sorceress Selena. She is controlling an army of an orc-like warrior race Skorl, who serve her with devotion. The Skorl hate humans and have terrorized the town and the nearby land. Diermot is an ordinary fellow who was captured by the Skorl and thrown into prison. His first task will be to escape. After gaining his freedom, Diermot will also have to find out how to liberate his entire homeland from the clutches of the villains.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lure/scummvm-lure-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game starts off with a short intro sequence that lays out the story. This is presented as mostly static images followed by walls of text, but it gets the point across pretty succinctly and then turns control over to you.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lure/scummvm-lure-00001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Interaction with the game world is intuitive for anyone familiar with adventure games. You move a cursor around the screen, which will change shape and call out action areas in the top left when you hover over them.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lure/scummvm-lure-00008.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Right-clicking on an action area will bring up a list of verbs you can select from to interact with it, and depending on the verb additional options will be made available.</p>

<p>Though certain verbs such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PULL</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PUSH</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">USE</code> are typically always available, additional interaction options like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TALK TO</code> won’t appear unless you select an NPC, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OPEN</code> if you select a door.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lure/scummvm-lure-00003.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The initial sequence in the prison where you start the game gets you acclimatized to the controls and introduces you to the first NPC, Ratpouch.</p>

<p>This was also where this became immediately frustrating, as once we escaped the dungeon Ratpouch wouldn’t follow me. I think I was about 20 minutes into this game before I was <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/lure_of_the_temptress/ratpouch_keeps_disappearing_and_reappearing_through_the_exit_of_the_sewers">looking on forums for help</a> to get this stupid NPC to follow me.</p>

<p>One interesting mechanic of this game is that certain NPCs will join you throughout the game, and once they do you can give them commands via the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TELL</code> verb. You can use this give them simple tasks, or chain together multiple commands to give them something more complex to do.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lure/scummvm-lure-1-00005.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Command chaining is required at one point in a cave where pulling certain skulls will open doors, but you need to coordinate these actions from different rooms. You’ll need to tell your companion NPC to first go to a different room, then pull a skull, then the other, then go to yet another room.</p>

<p>Figuring out the proper sequence of commands can be a bit frustrating as regardless of what commands Diermot issues, the result is the NPC agreeing and heading off to perform the actions … even if they’re not going to be helpful.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lure/scummvm-lure-00005.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Navigating the game world is straightforward as all exits are easily identifiable. The cursor will change to an arrow if you can exit the current screen in that direction, and once a door has been opened, the cursor will change to an arrow when you hover over it as well.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lure/scummvm-lure-00011.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game’s visual style is good, and though there aren’t really any cutscenes the odd time that one is presented it’s typically well done.</p>

<p>Unlike many games of this era, death isn’t waiting around every corner. I only found a handful of situations in this game that would result in a game over but I still found myself saving frequently “just in case”.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lure/scummvm-lure-1-00009.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though only used twice, there is a combat element to this game. When in the cave you find an axe and will have to fight a boar looking creature. I don’t know if this is also supposed to be a Skorl, but there’s really no details given and you kind of just get dropped into this sequence and are left to figure it out.</p>

<p>Combat just involves moving the mouse to either a high/medium/low position in front of you then left/right clicking to attack or block. Clicking both mouse buttons jumps. You need to hit this boar thing about 6-7 times to kill it, and if he hits you that many times you’ll die.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lure/scummvm-lure-1-00014.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The story progresses through a series of interactions with characters in town, then in the castle. These interactions are navigated using dialog trees, which are pretty common for adventure games of this era.</p>

<p>You’re typically presented with a number of options to choose from, with additional options being added based on other interactions you’ve had, items you’ve picked up or plot points you’ve completed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lure/scummvm-lure-1-00004.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Characters have their own “schedules”, so they’ll roam around town and perform certain actions at certain times. If a character bumps into you or another NPC they’ll apologize and try to navigate around the obstacle.</p>

<p>This can get a little funny when you have 2-3 characters on screen and you sort of stand between them all and watch them jostle around, constantly apologizing.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lure/scummvm-lure-1-00011.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>These NPCs include the Skorl, and to advance to the castle you’ll need to talk to Mallin to get a clue that there’s a Skorl acting suspiciously. When this happens you need to find a Skorl NPC and follow him around until he goes into a shop, where you can spy on him through the window.</p>

<p>When you learn the Skorl is going to take the shopkeeper to the castle in a barrel, you take his place to get transported there instead.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lure/scummvm-lure-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The final sequence is pretty straightforward and involves some item combination puzzles and a timing puzzle whereby you have to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TELL</code> Minnow to pull a lever so you can turn a crank and lower the drawbridge.</p>

<p>Crossing the drawbridge triggers the second combat sequence of the game with another boar looking thing. After defeating him you advance to Selena’s room, where she turns into a scorpion and you automatically throw the Eye of Gethryn at her and the game is done.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lure/scummvm-lure-1-00018.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Overall this game is not great, but it’s not bad. The puzzles weren’t overly complicated and there really aren’t that many areas to explore so the fact that there’s a lot of backtracking to complete fetch quests or find NPCs to talk to doesn’t get too frustrating.</p>

<p>I had problems getting the music to work, but this is <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/lure_of_the_temptress/lure_of_temptress_no_music_plays_intermittently">apparently also a common issue</a>. I ended up sorting this out by changing my ScummVM configuration to use FluidSynth instead of the MT-32 emulator I typically used.</p>

<p>This got the sound and music working, but the background music is typically just one or two notes repeated periodically. It’s actually pretty annoying so the effort I went to to get this fixed wasn’t really worth it.</p>

<p>I did find the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TELL</code> mechanic innovative, though underused. Being able to direct multiple NPCs at once could have made for some interesting puzzle designs, but I’m satisfied with what I got so this isn’t really a complaint.</p>

<p>Lure of the Temptress is <a href="https://scummvm.org/games/#games-lure:lure">free to download from ScummVM</a> so there’s really no reason not to give it a go if you’re a fan of the genre. It’s relatively short and fairly straightforward to play, though if you’re looking for a much better title from Revolution Software I would point you to <a href="/blog/2023/02/10/beneath-a-steel-sky/">Beneath a Steel Sky</a> instead 😉.</p>
