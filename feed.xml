I’ve always found myself going back to this genre, and as I grew up and moved into software development the ScummVM project held a certain appeal as it combined two passions for me. Though I was never very active in the project, I tried to contribute in various ways over the years, finally seeing some success re... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Generating a ScummVM Games List</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/05/31/generating-a-scummvm-games-list/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Generating a ScummVM Games List" /><published>2021-05-31T06:55:45-04:00</published> <updated>2021-08-04T06:47:52-04:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/05/31/generating-a-scummvm-games-list/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/05/31/generating-a-scummvm-games-list/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="Programming" /> <summary> 2021-06-01: Note that you can actually generate the games list directly from the scummvm binary by running scummvm --list-all-games. Oops … A long time ago I reached out to the ScummVM leadership about a script I’d been working on that could be used to scrape detection entries and generate a definitive games list.

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, mongod / mongos instances now output all log messages in structured JSON format. This includes log output sent to the file, syslog, and stdout (standard out) log destinations, as well as the output of the getLog command. The documentation includes Log Parsing Examples using the jq command line utility, but what i... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Sanitarium: The ScummVM Asylum Engine Journey Concludes</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/05/19/scummvm-asylum-engine/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sanitarium: The ScummVM Asylum Engine Journey Concludes" /><published>2021-05-19T06:32:45-04:00</published> <updated>2021-05-21T07:13:18-04:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/05/19/scummvm-asylum-engine/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/05/19/scummvm-asylum-engine/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="ScummVM" /> <summary> With PR#2982 - ENGINES: Sanitarium engine being recently merged into ScummVM I wanted to take some time to chronicle the original development efforts which began in 2009. At the time I was looking to work on a new engine in an attempt to improve my knowledge of C++ as well as to “give something back” to the open source community. Some of the engines I was toying with at the time included one’s... </summary> </entry> </feed>
