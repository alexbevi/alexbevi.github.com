<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Seed_(video_game)">Dark Seed</a> is a psychological horror point-and-click adventure game developed and published by Cyberdreams in 1992. It exhibits a normal world and a dark world counterpart, which is based on artwork by H. R. Giger. It was one of the first point-and-click adventure games to use high-resolution (640 × 350 pixels) graphics, to Giger’s demand.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/start_001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You play Mike Dawson, an ad company manager who, in pursuit of his goal in life to become a writer, purchases a solitary mansion in a small town called Woodland Hills. Although the low cost and hush-hush transactions when purchasing the house do raise your suspicion, the solitary environment and sheer beauty of the house crush common sense and you decide to buy the house. That’s when trouble begin. Upon reaching the house, you suddenly feel tired. You find a bed and fall asleep…</p>

<p>… and wake up from a terrible dream, only to find out that your life has just become a worse nightmare: an unknown source has implanted a seed of darkness in your mind, and you only have three days to find a way to stop it.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<em>Game error number 66 you say … I’m sure everything’s still fine though … right?</em></p>

<p>I have a feeling this is an issue with the environment I was playing the game in, but I could not get past the first section of the game no matter what I tried. I would go through the initial motions to take a shower and take pills, go downstairs and answer the door, go outside and pick up the package … and the game would just restart! I honestly thought this was on purpose the first few times, but when I’d go to save or load the game it showed an error message … which seemed odd.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/command_000.png" alt="" />
<em>It’s been a hot minute since I’ve busted out the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/attrib"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ATTRIB</code></a> command</em></p>

<p>After cruising the internet I stumbled on a <a href="https://www.gameboomers.com/forum/ubbthreads.php/topics/136455/dos-game-dark-seed">discussion that seemed to cover the exact issue</a> I was experiencing, and the solution was to change the properties of the installed files.</p>

<p>On the off chance anyone reads this review that has this problem, the solution is to go to the install directory for Darkseed in DOSBox and run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ATTRIB -R *.*</code> to remove the readonly attribute on the game’s files.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/start_002.png" alt="" />
<em>What a pretty doll someone sent me for some reason that isn’t suspicious at all</em></p>

<p>Once I could successfully pick up the package on Day 1, the game allowed me to progress an there were no further issues.</p>

<p>Dark Seed takes place over the course of 3 days, with each day of game time taking roughly an hour of actual time. Time and timing is a huge factor in this game - certain events only happen at certain times, and if you take too much or too little time you can miss things. This is actually extremely frustrating as there’s typically no indication that a certain event will be triggered at a specific time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/tos_009.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If it gets too late in the day Mike will decide it’s time for bed and go to sleep. Assuming you’ve done nothing about the headaches or you pass the 3 day mark, the alien embryo implanted in your brain will hatch and it’s game over.</p>

<p>Seeing as time is such a huge element of this game, it’s a bit surprising that you don’t have a default mechanism at your disposal to tell time right from the beginning. You can find a watch in the attic (hidden under a trunk you need to push out of the way), or you can backtrack to your living room and look at the grandfather clock, but I would have expected it to be a lot more prominently displayed (maybe in the main game UI).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/tos_010.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/DARK_SEED_QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD">Quick Reference Card</a> tells you you can press the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code> key at any point to advance time to the top of the next hour in case you find yourself “with lots of time to kill”. They allude to the fact you need to wait around for certain events to trigger, but not what they may be, when they’ll occur or on what screens.</p>

<p>My gameplay process (once I better understood the time mechanic) was to save the game, go to various screens and mash the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code> key a bunch of times to see if anything triggered before Mike said he was tired and it was time for bed. This would at least give me some clue as to what might be needed on that screen (and at what time). This isn’t particularly fun - but it at least helped me progress.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/tos_000.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The interface is that of a typical point-and-click game from this time period. You have your inventory at the top of the screen and a handful of interaction options you can cycle through by right-clicking the mouse. Mike can be moved around the screen, and if you mouse over a hot-spot you can cycle through various action icons like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TAKE</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">USE</code>, etc.</p>

<p>The game world is pretty small and is split into two main areas: reality, and the dark world. Reality is Mike’s house, the town and a cemetary. These make up about a dozen areas you can explore, which have a mirror version in the dark world. This is actually a pretty cool dynamic, as part of the puzzle solving process is changing things in reality to see how it changes the dark world.</p>

<p>For example, when you get thrown in jail you can stash some items under the pillow. When you find yourself in jail in the dark world, those items will be waiting for you.</p>

<p>Getting to the dark world is done by walking through the mirror in your living room. You need to fix the mirror first (it’s missing a chunk in the bottom corner that gets sent to you in the mail), but this happens pretty early in the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/tos_007.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Navigating the dark world is pretty straightforward once you realize it’s a mirror image of reality. There are some aliens you’ll need to interact with and a couple puzzles to solve, but you actually don’t have a whole lot to do here - which is a shame because it looks awesome.</p>

<p>Since the artwork was inspired by H. R. Giger’s work, everything has this Aliens vibe. The creature designs definitely have that unique Giger style, and every cutscene plays out so much better as a result.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it’s not obvious what you need to do most of the time, and it’s VERY easy to miss things and find yourself in an unwinnable situation. For example, if you enter the dark world too late in the day Mike might fall asleep on a random screen if he decides it’s bed time - and this results in you dying. The game doesn’t actually tell you that’s what’s happening though - you just randomly fall over and the game restarts.</p>

<p>Save early, save often - maintain MANY save files!</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/tos_018.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Most of the clues you get are from examining items you find along the way. They do help point you in the right direction most of the time, but this game can be pretty challenging where there are gaps in the narrative.</p>

<p>As you proceed you’ll find yourself listening to the same short music samples looping on each screen. These are very repetitive and very annoying. You spend a lot of time roaming around your house, and the house “theme” is the worst of them all. If the goal was to create a sense of “you’re going insane” - mission accomplished!</p>

<p>It’s a bit of a slog to get through this game, but thankfully it’s easy to find walkthroughs … and the game itself is pretty short.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/tos_020.png" alt="" />
<em>You sell your house - game over</em></p>

<p>Apparently your objective was to smash the mirror in your house to sever the connection between reality and the dark world. Building the magic hammer you need to smash the mirror is the only item combination puzzle in the game, so it’s not intuitive - and also it’s not really obvious this is what you’re supposed to be doing.</p>

<p>Regardless, you make this hammer, go back to reality to start the car in the garage, go back to the dark world to launch some spaceship (that is the mirror version of the car I think), go back to reality to smash the mirror and the game is over.</p>

<p>I struggled a lot with the endgame as nothing you had to do made any sense. I tried … failed … consulted the walkthrough … and was done with it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/darkseed/tos_017.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This game had a lot of promise. I really liked the premise, and the story is actually pretty interesting but you find yourself rushing through everything because of the rigid time mechanic.</p>

<p>It’s also not a very hard game, though certain puzzles aren’t intuitive which can be frustrating.</p>

<p>Though I wouldn’t recommend this game, I can’t say I had a bad time playing it. I’m actually looking forward to the sequel (<a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/4257/dark-seed-ii/">Dark Seed II</a>) to see how they build on the initial story and if they can iron out some of the rough edges.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Cauldron_(video_game)">The Black Cauldron</a> is an adventure game designed by Al Lowe of Sierra On-Line and published in 1986. The game is based on the Disney film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Cauldron_(film)">The Black Cauldron</a>, which was itself based on the Chronicles of Prydain novel of the same name by Lloyd Alexander. It was made shortly after the first King’s Quest game, so it resembles that game in many ways. Along with The Dark Crystal it remains one of only a few adventure games by Sierra to be based on films.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/bc/scummvm-bc-1-00015.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though this game was released in 1986, I played the v2 release from 1988 which I believe is “updated” somewhat because it felt like I was playing King’s Quest III but using Roger Wilco from Space Quest I. If you look at the screenshots from the <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/194/the-black-cauldron/screenshots/apple2gs/">Apple IIgs release</a> it looks more like KQ1.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/bc/iScreen Shoter - 20231114072843099.png" alt="" />
<em>I tried watching the movie a bit while playing the game, but lost interest pretty quickly</em></p>

<p>Honestly, the movie this game was based on isn’t something I have fond memories of as a child. I seem to remember watching it and not really liking it as it felt like a lamer version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sword_in_the_Stone_(1963_film)">The Sword in the Stone</a> (which I loved). I even had the movie playing in the background for a bit to see if I could get back into it … but I couldn’t.</p>

<p>As a result, I had to rely on the story as the game presented it and couldn’t fill in the gaps from memory. This proved to be challenging as there’s really not much of an introduction - after the title screen you’re just dropped into the first scene in front of Dallben’s cottage. When you go inside he tells you to go feed your pig … because she’s special for some reason.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/bc/scummvm-bc-1-00001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To get into the cottage you have to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DO</code> the door once you walk up to it. This threw me off at first, as the game doesn’t have a text parser and you only have access to 3 verbs at any point: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">USE</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DO</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code> - with these all being mapped to function keys.</p>

<p>Though it felt “wrong” at first, this interface was actually extremely innovative and forward thinking as the same concept would ultimately dominate the “point and click” variations of these games once using the mouse became the primary driver for interaction.</p>

<p>If you replace the function keys with a command bar of actions (like in Sierra SCI games), or the context popup menus from LucasFilm games - this game did it first.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/bc/scummvm-bc-1-00009.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is an AGI game, so you primary navigate using the directional arrows on your keyboard - but you can also use the mouse. I found this incredibly useful for navigating tight diagonal sections such as climbing the rope to the Horned King’s castle. If you try and do this with incremental <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UP</code>+<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LEFT</code> presses, you’re going to fall - and you’re going to die.</p>

<p>Since this is a Sierra game, death is around most corners. You also occasionally get thirsty or hungry, and if you don’t deal with that quickly - you die. Honestly this wasn’t too big of a challenge once you find the “food wallet” as it contains unlimited food, and the water flask can be filled to contain three or four drinks worth of water.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/bc/scummvm-bc-1-00003.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Progressing through the game just involves mashing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DO</code> keys on most screens to identify what you’re supposed to interact with, then interacting with it. Since the same hotkey is used for opening/closing things, talking to characters, and picking up items you get used to the limited actions the game provides pretty quickly.</p>

<p>Some locations (like the cupboard in cottage) contain multiple items. As you pick items up, if there’s something “behind” it, the game will show you this right away so you’re unlikely to miss anything. This is really helpful, though I did miss the lute the first time around because when you <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DO</code> the hole in the tree the first time it just tells you there’s a lute there - the second <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DO</code> actually picks it up.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/bc/scummvm-bc-1-00012.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game world is a lot smaller than most AGI games of this era, so it doesn’t take long to explore it all. Eventually you make it to the castle where there’s a princess you’re supposed to rescue - though I don’t remember her being introduced at any point before you find her.</p>

<p>Once you find the room in the basement where she can squeeze through a hold and escape, she’s gone until the final credit sequence. I have a feeling based on the bit of the move I was able to watch that she’s a lot more important to the plot, but this isn’t really communicated by the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/bc/scummvm-bc-1-00014.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You’ll find a sword in the castle that you can pick up and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">USE</code> on the castle guard. If you don’t, he’ll catch you and it’s game over (except the first time you enter the castle and he throws you in the basement instead). Of all the items you can pick up and use, the sword is one of the only ones that you can “see” being used as the action of swinging it is animated. The other is the fairy dust, which if you sprinkle it you’ll be able to fly around for a few seconds, which is useful later in the game as it lets you skip jumping on stones to cross the swamp.</p>

<p>Though you can use the other items they’ll just give you a description on screen as to what their effect (or lack thereof) was.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/bc/scummvm-bc-1-00017.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Eventually you get to the 3 witches (I think that’s what they are) who you trade your sword to for the black cauldron, which is promptly stolen by a dragon and flown back to the Horned King’s castle. You then need to backtrack all the way to the castle, find the Horned King in the basement and show him the mirror - which makes him stumble backwards and fall into the cauldron.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/bc/scummvm-bc-1-00020.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Playing through this game is predominantly silent. There is a title screen with PC speaker music, and some sound effects throughout (beeps and boops mostly) but that’s about it.</p>

<p>Apparently this game actually has multiple endings and there’re some branching paths. The annoying monster you meet right at the beginning (Gurgi) can show up and jump in the cauldron at the end instead of the Horned King if you follow a certain path. This is apparently how the movie plays out (I had to look this up), which is kind of cool.</p>

<p>Overall this game was just “Ok”. I thought replacing the text parser with a couple of function keys was an interesting choice and streamlined the interaction with the game world. This is definitely a very approachable adventure game, and though I didn’t fully watch the movie before playing it - it does seem to follow the plot. If you’re a fan of the movie I have a feeling you’d enjoy playing this game.</p>

<p>I didn’t realize the movie this was based on was the first Disney animated film to (1) receive a PG rating, and (2) to include computer generated imagery. Considering this was released in 1985, the latter point is pretty impressive :)</p>

<p>If you’re a fan of the movie, you might enjoy playing this game but as an adventure game fan I wouldn’t recommend it. For anyone looking for a Sierra AGI game from this era, there are better options.</p>

The MongoDB Atlas documentation outlines several methods to <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/troubleshoot-connection/">troubleshoot connection issues</a>, including how to handle <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/troubleshoot-connection/#connection-refused-using-srv-connection-string">“Connection Refused using SRV Connection String”</a> scenarios, but why does this happen in the first place?</p>

<h2 id="about-dns-seedlists">About DNS seedlists</h2>

<p>To coincide with the release of MongoDB 3.6, all drivers (at the time) implemented the <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/initial-dns-seedlist-discovery/initial-dns-seedlist-discovery.rst">initial DNS seedlist discovery</a> specification to ensure connections could be established using the new <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#std-label-connections-dns-seedlist"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SRV</code> connection string format</a>, as well as the legacy <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#standard-connection-string-format">standard connection string format</a>.</p>

<p>This functionality was introduced to abstract away the complexity of MongoDB’s connection strings (for MongoDB Atlas users at least) by moving the component parts of a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/">connection string</a> to two DNS records: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV_record">service record (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SRV</code>)</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TXT_record">text record (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TXT</code>)</a>.</p>

<p>Users now only need to supply a connection string such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongodb+srv://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@cluster0.abcde.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase</code>, and regardless as to whether the underlying cluster was a replica set or sharded, the connection string would remain the same. Furthermore, if the replica set were changed (members added/removed, shards added/removed), no change would be needed at the application level!<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Tools such as <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/nslookup"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nslookup</code></a> or <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/dig"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dig</code></a> can be used to view the contents of these DNS records, such as in the following example:</p>

<h2 id="what-can-go-wrong">What can go wrong?</h2>

<p>MongoDB’s drivers require the information from <em>both</em> DNS queries in order to successfully establish, authenticate and authorize a connection to a MongoDB Atlas cluster. If either of these queries fail, only part of the connection string details will be present, and if the driver doesn’t error out right away, the subsequent connection attempt may be missing necessary information.</p>

<p>For example, per the <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/auth/auth.rst#implementation">Authentication specification</a> regarding connection string options, when it comes to selecting the authentication source:</p>
<ol>
  <li>if <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#mongodb-urioption-urioption.authSource"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">authSource</code></a> is specified, it is used.</li>
  <li>otherwise, if database is specified (in the connection string), it is used.</li>
  <li>otherwise, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">admin</code> database is used.</li>
</ol>

<p>Given this order of operations, if the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SRV</code> record resolves, but the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TXT</code> record <em>doesn’t</em>, assuming the driver doesn’t error out first the database provided in the connection string will be used for authentication. Using our original example of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongodb+srv://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@cluster0.abcde.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase</code>, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">myFirstDatabase</code> database will be used to authenticate …. which will result in an authentication failure such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MongoServerError: Authentication failed</code>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, though MongoDB’s drivers support automatic retryability of <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/retryable-reads/">reads</a> and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/retryable-writes/">writes</a>, these DNS query failures aren’t retryable. There is currently a project proposed (<a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DRIVERS-2757">DRIVERS-2757</a>) to improve this in the future, but for now these errors bubble up to the application immediately.</p>

<h2 id="can-these-issues-be-prevented">Can these issues be prevented?</h2>

<p>The best way to avoid these issues entirely is to just use the legacy <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#standard-connection-string-format">standard connection string format</a>. If you’re connecting to a replica set, the <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-discovery-and-monitoring.rst">server discovery and monitoring</a> functionality of each driver will ensure topology changes are automatically discovered.</p>

<p>Note that this will prevent new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongos</code>’ from being discovered in a sharded cluster, however if you don’t anticipate these to change frequently this will likely be a non-issue as well.</p>

<h2 id="are-other-drivers-affected">Are other drivers affected?</h2>

<p>Failure to resolve DNS records can affect all MongoDB drivers, however it’s highly unlikely you’ll actually encounter this in a production setting. As there still remains a non-zero chance this issue will manifest, here are some examples of failures you may see from other drivers:</p>

<p>Note that (per the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo#hdr-Potential_DNS_Issues">MongoDB Go driver documentation</a>):</p>

  <p>Building with Go 1.11+ and using connection strings with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongodb+srv</code> scheme is unfortunately incompatible with some DNS servers in the wild due to the change introduced in https://github.com/golang/go/issues/10622. You may receive an error with the message “cannot unmarshal DNS message” while running an operation when using DNS servers that non-compliantly compress SRV records. Old versions of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kube-dns</code> and the native DNS resolver (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">systemd-resolver</code>) on Ubuntu 18.04 are known to be non-compliant in this manner. We suggest using a different DNS server (8.8.8.8 is the common default), and, if that’s not possible, avoiding the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongodb+srv</code> scheme.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="dns-is-hard-">DNS is hard …</h2>

<p>It sure can be, as intermittent/transient network events can also impact MongoDB drivers’ ability to resolve DNS queries. The drivers (typically) rely on low-level OS APIs (such as <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/getaddrinfo"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getaddrinfo</code></a>) for network address and service translation. As such you may occasionally get errors such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MongooseServerSelectionError: getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN cluster0-shard-00-01.abcde.mongodb.net</code> even when using the legacy (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongodb://</code>) URI scheme.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_in_Time_(video_game)">Lost in Time</a> is a computer adventure game developed and published by Coktel Vision in 1993. It was promoted as being “The first Interactive Adventure Film using Full Motion Video Technology” and contained four graphical elements: full motion video, hand painted and digitized backgrounds and 3D decor.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lit/scummvm-lit-us-00001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This game had a lot of promise based on the description, and when I started reading up on the story I got a little excited. Unfortunately, that didn’t last and as soon as you start playing this game you realize it’s just not that good.</p>

<p>Lost in Time doesn’t really introduce the story at all as the game sort of just “starts” in the hold of a ship. You’ll piece together bits of backstory as you go and discover there’s some undertones of time travel and you’re at the center of it all somehow but it didn’t really flow very well.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lit/scummvm-lit-us-00007.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Eventually you’ll open a door and find Melkior, who is a member of the time police or something to that effect. You’ll need to free him, but this will involve solving a bunch of item combination puzzles, which first involves finding the items.</p>

<p>This game is one giant fetch quest, but it manages to execute these in the most obtuse and least fun ways possible. Each static screen only has a handful of hot-spots you can interact with so it’s not too difficult to identify <em>what</em> you need to click on, but it’s not obvious that you’ll need to revisit some of these repeatedly.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lit/scummvm-lit-us-00008.png" alt="" />
<em>You’ll see this screen a lot throughout the game</em></p>

<p>There were a couple releases of this game - text only and fully voice acted. I opted for the latter, which in hindsight was a mistake. The voice acting in this game is atrocious. The lip synching is typically off (which is fine for 1993), but the actors are really shooting for the moon with their performances. It doesn’t help that every time Doralice (the protagonist) has anything you say you get this same visual representation of half her face moving up and down.</p>

<p>It was a missed opportunity when they released this game on CD that they did’t include the subtitles that were present in the disk version. The voice acting is slow and drawn out - and you can’t skip any of it. I’m fairly certain you couldn’t make the text advance any faster in the disk version but it felt less irritating none the less.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lit/scummvm-lit-us-00005.png" alt="" />
<em>What are jokers and why do I have three of them?</em></p>

<p>The game has (what I believe to be) a hint system called “Jokers”. The game doesn’t give you any indication what these are, why they’re limited, or why they’re only present in select places. Even going back and reading through the <a href="https://www.starehry.eu/download/adventure/docs/Lostintime-Manual.pdf">game’s manual</a> only tells you:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“There are a few “jokers” available in various places throughout the game that will give you some hints if you are stuck. You are only allowed to use three”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’re curious to play this game give the manual a read as it does introduce the game’s concepts and characters much better than the game itself does.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lit/scummvm-lit-us-00013.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To play this game is to just click every labelled hotspot (multiple times), then try and combine everything with everything. For the limited number of interactive areas per screen there are A LOT of items you’ll need to collect, combine and try on each screen. Since this is an adventure game this mechanic isn’t surprising, but the types of item combinations you need to perform are unintuitive in many cases.</p>

<p>You’ll also need to be aware of items that contain other items that you’ll need to “remove” from their containers to use them properly. You may also find yourself combining items “in the wrong order” which doesn’t give you any indication that you’re doing something wrong …</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lit/scummvm-lit-us-00022.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Since there’s going to be a lot of backtracking it is convenient that the game gives you a fast-travel map. There are only three “levels” in this game, so there’s really not much you need to explore, but the sheer amount of backtracking to these static screens just to attempt to use every new item with every existing item and every possible hotspot draws this out unnecessarily.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lit/scummvm-lit-us-00028.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The reviews of this game (at time of release) were generally positive for how the live-action video was incorporated. Honestly it’s pretty hard to watch and feels out of place and not overly well done. Seeing as this game came out the same years as “The 7th Guest” and “Myst” you can’t even point to it and say “well, it was good for 1993”.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it’s not just the video and voice acting that sucks in this game. The sound effects feel out of place throughout the game and really give you the sense that they’re just stock effects the developers threw together. Overall it’s just not a good game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/lit/scummvm-lit-us-00034.png" alt="" />
<em>OMG THE GAME ENDS WITH HIM LOOKING AT THE CAMERA AND FUCKING WINKING!!!</em></p>

<p>Lost in Time is not fun. So far Coktel Vision games just aren’t very good … and there are still many more to go in this series. It’s so frustrating that you need to “re-look” at many areas in this game <em>after</em> you pick items up as they may contain another item that wasn’t visible when you first inspected the area. For example, there’s a drawer you open at one point to pick up a diary … then if you click the drawer again you open it <em>more</em> to find something else. WHY NOT JUST SHOW 2 ITEMS IN THE DRAWER THE FIRST TIME???</p>

<p>You can also miss items easily, and will lose the game if you don’t remember to “remove” the flower from the bag on the last screen before catching the snake and throwing the bag in the fire. Why you ask? Because you need to throw the flower at the main antagonist to make him sneeze and fall to his death off a log bridge you somehow find yourself on for the final conflict.</p>

<p>I really wanted to like this game, but I really didn’t. I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventureland_(video_game)">Adventureland</a> is a text adventure video game for microcomputers released by Scott Adams in 1978. The game has no plot but simply involves searching for thirteen lost artifacts in a fantasy setting. Its success led Adams to form Adventure International which went on to publish thirteen similar games in the Adventure series, each in different settings.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/advland/001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I opted to play the Commodore 64 release of this game as it was a slight upgrade to the original text adventure format. This also gave me a chance to try out a new emulator - <a href="https://dirkwhoffmann.github.io/virtualc64/">VirtualC64</a>. If you’re an OSX user I would highly recommend this as <a href="https://www.dirkwhoffmann.de/">Dirk Hoffmann</a> has created an extremely intuitive user experience here (as he did with <a href="https://dirkwhoffmann.github.io/vAmiga/">vAmiga</a>).</p>

<p>The game’s “UI” is split into three parts. You have the visualization of the room on the top half and the text parser on the bottom half, but if you press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ENTER</code> the visualization is replaced with a description of the scene.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/advland/011.png" alt="" />
<em>Press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ENTER</code> for a summary of the screen including exits and items</em></p>

<p>Once you realize that this third view exists the game gets a lot easier as all exits and items you can collect become obvious. The goal of the game is to just pick up various “treasures”, which you’ll have to drop into a stump on one screen until you’ve found them all.</p>

<p>There’s no real plot to this game - it’s just a treasure hunt. Dropping and picking up items is pretty important though as you need to collect the various treasures, but you can only carry so many items at once.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/advland/010.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Having the visualization of the scene is useful as it can give you clues as well. It’s not obvious that you “extinguish” the lamp when you’re not using it by issuing a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UNLIGHT LAMP</code> command - until you enter the maze and see that verb on the wall. I’m assuming this would be presented in the original TRS-80 text adventure as just part of the scene description, but I appreciated this additional use of the “eye candy” to convey practical information.</p>

<p>Speaking of the TRS-80 version, <a href="https://archive.org/details/softside-magazine-22/page/n35/mode/2up?view=theater">SoftSide magazine’s July, 1980 edition</a> included the full TRS-80 source code that you could manually type out yourself!</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/advland/018.png" alt="" />
<em>Oh I see, I just need to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAM LAVA</code> to proceed. So obvious …</em></p>

<p>For a graphical adventure game released in 1982 the game is what you’d expect. The static scenes aren’t bad, the parser is extremely limited and some of the verb/object combinations are a bit cumbersome to come up with, but overall the game does a good job of guiding you.</p>

<p>There are no sound effects or music or story - and the game is incredibly short. It took me about half an hour to work through this, though the <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/23143">How Long To Beat</a> timing is apparently only 5 minutes.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/advland/020.png" alt="" />
<em>Find all 13 treasures, drop them in the stump … and that’s all she wrote</em></p>

<p>To make this game a bit more challenging there are a handful of ways you can die (ex: carrying the mud to the screen where the dragon is). When this happens you wind up in Limbo, where you just walk through a door that results in you “restarting” the game from the beginning. You can also reach a dead end by doing certain actions too early (ex: chopping down the tree before climbing it to pick up the skeleton keys).</p>

<p>This is a very early adventure game - and an improvement to an <em>even EARLIER</em> adventure game at that! It doesn’t really do anything new or innovative compared to other games released around this time so I can’t find any reason to recommend it. If you feel ambitious and want to type out the source code, go for it - or head on over to this <a href="https://github.com/ahope1/Beeb-Adventureland">GitHub repository</a> instead ;) There’s a great companion article called <a href="https://ahopeful.wordpress.com/2020/09/13/digging-up-adventureland-scott-adams-1980/">“Digging up Adventureland (Scott Adams, 1980)”</a> that details the creation of that BBC BASIC port of the TRS-80 code.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_with_Rama_(video_game)">Rendezvous with Rama</a> is an interactive fiction game with graphics published by Telarium, a subsidiary of Spinnaker Software, in 1984. It was developed in cooperation with Arthur C. Clarke and based upon his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_with_Rama">1973 science fiction novel Rendezvous with Rama</a>.</p>

<p>After an uncatalogued giant asteroid is discovered approaching Earth, scientists soon realize that it is in reality an alien starship. As commander of the spaceship Endeavor, and being the nearest to the gargantuan ship, it is up to you to rendezvous with it and explore it before it leaves the Solar system.</p>

<p>I was actually really excited to play this game as I was a huge fan of the books in my early teens. The Rama series of books were one of the few full series I actually re-read more than once (along with Ringworld and Dune). Since this was an earlier adventure game I expected the experience to be a lot more akin to an interactive fiction game than an adventure game … which turned out to be a pretty accurate assessment.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/rdv/rdv_004.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You start off in your ship, and the first order of business is to get to the navigation console to maneuver towards the giant ship you’re there to investigate. This is done by choosing a direction (ex: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EAST</code>), which will redraw the screen with an updated description of where you are and some clues as to what you can interact with. Once you get to the navigation console you can either turn on the autopilot, or you can manually try to dock with RAMA. I opted for the autopilot, so I’m not really sure how difficult the manual approach would have been.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/rdv/rdv_007.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once docked, you put on your spacesuit, navigate the airlock and are onboard the ship. From here you start moving around from screen to screen trying to figure out what this ship is and what secrets it holds. Every screen is extremely well described, so it’s pretty obvious <em>what</em> you can interact with … but it’s not always obvious <em>how</em> you’re supposed to describe your interactions.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/rdv/rdv_011.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The latter half of the game requires you to use your simp companion (a monkey named Goldie) to follow instructions to help you solve various puzzles. The instructions need to be incredibly precise or else you’ll just get a generic error. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GOLDIE CLIMB UP</code> won’t work, but adding a comma and issuing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GOLDIE, CLIMB UP</code> will.</p>

<p>I’ll be perfectly honest, I needed to rely pretty heavily on the walkthrough to get through this game as I was not having a great time getting the commands entered in a way that would please the game’s parser.</p>

<em>Dragonfly sequence from the Apple II release</em></p>

<p>This game was one of the first titles I picked up for this series, but I found myself getting stuck and unable to progress almost a dozen times. I played both the Commodore 64 and Apple II versions at least a handful of times, and each time I’d get to an area of Rama where I’d try to descend into a pit and the game would just freeze.</p>

<p>There’s a sequence where you need to play through an arcade game on your flying craft called the dragonfly. If you fail the minigame you just crash land in the same spot you’d end up in if you won, so I didn’t think much of it. After getting stuck in 2 different versions of the game after crashing I thought maybe you need to win the minigame to progress.</p>

<p>I did this on the Apple II release, won, made my way through Rama to the spot I kept getting stuck at …….. and still got stuck. I don’t know if there’s an issue with the ROMs I found for these systems, but I replayed the first half of this game more times than I’d like to admit.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/rdv/rdv_008.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The DOS release of the game doesn’t include the minigame at all, which is why I ended up playing through that version. It wasn’t for lack of trying with the Commodore 64 or Apple II releases though, as I enjoyed those versions a little better.</p>

<p>When comparing the visuals of the DOS port to the others, the colour palette is just bland. Most screens only have 2 colours and tend to look like baby puke on the screen. The other ports tried a bit harder and blended up to 4 colours per screen, which was noticeably more visually appealing.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/rdv/rdv_017.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You’ve only got a limited amount of time to investigate Rama, as the ship is on a crash-course with the sun. Once you get through the game and return to your ship you discover Rama is actually navigating around the sun to use the gravitational force to slingshot itself out of our solar system.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure this game follows some elements of the book pretty closely, but I don’t remember there being any monkeys you needed to rely on to solve puzzles. It’s been at least 30 years since I last read the book so it’s possible I’m misremembering and the story of the game is even more faithful to the source material than I think it is.</p>

<p>This is a very story heavy game without really much to do. There is some PC speaker style beeps and boops for music and sound effects on certain screens, but nothing outstanding. I can’t hold this against a game from 1984 though, so I applaud the effort.</p>

<p>Having finished the game I’m motivated to revisit the story again - but I think I’ll just <a href="https://www.audible.ca/pd/Rendezvous-with-Rama-Audiobook/B06ZYNRMZW">listen to the audiobook</a> this time around. Though it was nice to spend some time in this world again, I don’t think I’d recommend the game to anyone - but if you’re looking for a good book …</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner_(1997_video_game)">Blade Runner</a> is a point-and-click adventure game developed by Westwood Studios and published by Virgin Interactive for Microsoft Windows, released on November 14, 1997. The game is not a direct adaptation of the 1982 Ridley Scott film Blade Runner but is instead a “sidequel”, telling an original story, which runs parallel to the film’s plot, occasionally intersecting with it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/br/scummvm-bladerunner-win-00001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Set in 2019 Los Angeles, the game tells the story of Ray McCoy, an elite detective charged with hunting down a group of dangerous replicants (bioengineered androids designed to look and act like humans). Although several of the film’s characters appear in the game, with some of the original actors returning to voice them, the film’s protagonist, Rick Deckard, does not appear in a speaking role. Instead, he is referred to on multiple occasions, is seen several times, and his activities as depicted in the film are mentioned. Other parallels with the film include the reproduction of several prominent locations, as well as scenes and dialogue closely modelled on the original. The game also features extracts from the film’s soundtrack.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/br/scummvm-bladerunner-win-00016.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When the game starts you’re investigating an attack at an animal store. Apparently the place has been shot up, but it doesn’t appear to be a robbery so McCoy is tasked with trying to find out who did it an why. This is done by sweeping the cursor over the scene to see when it either turns green (so you can interact with something), or blue (so you can move in that direction).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/br/scummvm-bladerunner-win-00008.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This game has an interesting character interaction mechanic, as you can select a <em>Conversation Choice</em> from you options screen before engaging in a conversation. These choices set the tone for the conversation and depending on what you pick can effect the information you get back. This is what I assumed at least, but I only played around with it at the very beginning of the game, then set it to the question mark and sort of just left it there.</p>

<p>The KIA, which is your personal computer (and where you change options or save/load the game) is also where you can review the evidence you’ve collected during your investigation. This is extremely helpful as you can review conversations you’ve had, as well as see what evidence you’ve picked up or hardcopies you’ve printed while analyzing photos.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/br/scummvm-bladerunner-win-00012.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Remember that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHepKd38pr0">scene in the movie where Deckard is enhancing a photo?</a> You guessed it, that mechanic makes its way into this game, and is actually used a few times to advance the plot. Honestly I remember when I originally played this game I spent a lot of time with each photo you get access to just trying to enhance every possible section to see if it hid more clues.</p>

<p>It’s pretty cool how these 2D photos can be sort of navigated in 3D, as you can uncover details “behind” or “around” certain sections to make details appear such as faces.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/br/scummvm-bladerunner-win-00010.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Not all aspects of the movie translate to “fun” when made into playable elements of the game. The Voight-Kampff test that is used to determine if someone is a replicant or human can be administered to various characters, but I found that it was more tedious than enjoyable. You’re basically just clicking one of three buttons to ask questions of varying degrees of “difficulty” to the subject. You don’t see the subject reacting - just a picture of an eyeball and an arbitrary meter than is supposed to (I think) show “reaction time”.</p>

<p>I sort of just kept mashing the buttons until the game decided on a result and I was allowed to move on.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/br/scummvm-bladerunner-win-00022.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are a handful of characters you can interact with throughout the game, and as you progress you’ll be given certain dialogue options you can use to learn more about your investigation. You can only ask characters about a certain topic once (in most cases), so it’s extra helpful that anything important to the main story is also captured in your KIA as evidence so that you can revisit it later if needed.</p>

<p>This game is fully voiced, and the voice actors are quite good. The background music is also very atmospheric and borrows heavily from the movie. This makes for an extremely immersive experience.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/br/scummvm-bladerunner-win-00006.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Your job as a blade runner is ultimately to “retire” replicants. As such, you’ve got your trusty sidearm with you at all times, which you can whip out pretty much any time and start firing. There’s a firing range at the police station you can visit at any point and run through to get some practice, and you will need to take out a couple characters (and some rats in the sewers), but overall the gun plays a pretty minor role over the course of the game.</p>

<p>There are three different difficulty levels you can play through the game at (Easy, Normal, Hard), and I opted for easy. This gives you unlimited ammo and I’m assuming also makez it easier to kill your targets … and possibly some other things I didn’t notice.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/br/scummvm-bladerunner-win-00002.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Overall I’d say this is a pretty solid, well made game … but the cutscenes are awful. For a game made in 1997 the character models are rigid and lack emotion, the lip syncing is terrible at best and the movements are wooden. It really detracts from an otherwise excellent game as it feels like it was slapped together. Seriously, when you watch the cutscenes it looks like someone made a stop-action video with marionettes.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/br/scummvm-bladerunner-win-00026.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For me, the story is everything in these games … and Blade Runner doesn’t disappoint. Since it’s based in the same “universe” as the original movie you get to enjoy some minor crossovers, but overall it’s a new adventure that leverages the elements of the movie that made it a cult classic. Your humanity is brought into question, you’re framed for a crime and need to clear your name and your decisions throughout the game have consequences.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/br/scummvm-bladerunner-win-00029.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are multiple endings, but I didn’t go back to try any of these out. I do think it’s pretty cool that the game leaves it up to you how you want to finish act 5 and decide “which side you’re on”.</p>

<p>I’ve had this game on my short list for almost a decade because I remember owning this when it came out and never finishing it. I was a huge fan of the movie and had fond memories of the game’s story as well, but never managed to make it more than half way through at the time.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xwnmjq/dedicated-fans-spent-8-years-making-the-1997-blade-runner-game-run-on-a-modern-pc">the reverse engineering began</a> and it looked like this game would be playable in ScummVM I got extremely excited. This game was recently re-released as the “Enhanced Edition”, but apparently that version was so badly done they <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blade-runner-enhanced-edition-unpopular-adds-original-1997-version">re-re-released it with the 1997 version</a>. The ScummVM devs really did some great work bringing this game back for modern systems, and I believe they also added the subtitles to the game.</p>

<p>Cutscene quality aside, I’d recommend this game to any adventure game fan - as long as they’re playing the original release via ScummVM ;)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripper_(video_game)">Ripper</a> is a 1996 interactive movie point-and-click adventure game developed and published by Take-Two Interactive for MS-DOS and Macintosh. The cast includes Christopher Walken, Paul Giamatti, Karen Allen, Burgess Meredith (in his final performance before his death the following year), David Patrick Kelly, Ossie Davis, and John Rhys-Davies. The villain of the game is chosen at random from the four main characters. A limited number of the clues and puzzles, plus a single line of dialogue in the ending, change according to the villain’s identity.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ripper/ripper_005.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is an FMV game, so you start off with an intro movie that sets up the premise for the game. Right away you’re drawn into this world as the credits roll and you realize the cast is a bunch of actual actors - all while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4HA3vUv2c">Blue Öyster Cult’s <em>(Don’t Fear) The Reaper</em></a> plays in the background. This interactive movie is going to play out more like a movie than a game … I can feel it … and I’m fucking excited!</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ripper/ripper_001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once the opening sequence completes you find yourself in a room with Detective Magnotta, played by none other than Christopher Walken. He delivers his lines in a very “Walkenesque” fashion, which just further draws you into the game world right off the hop. As a meta note, Walken and <em>Don’t Fear the Reaper</em> would be reunited a few years later on the SNL skit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_Cowbell">“More Cowbell”</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ripper/ripper_022.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You play the part of a reporter - Jake Quinlan - who is covering the Ripper murders. Apparently the Ripper communicates with you directly for some reason, so you find yourself on at the scene of a murder where you first meet Magnotta. There are a very limited number of things you can do in the game world, so you sweep the mouse over the screen to see if the cursor changes to a different kind of icon.</p>

<p>Basically you can move around, inspect, pick up, use or talk - typical adventure game actions. Unlike most adventure games though, these actions are very intentional on their targets so you can’t pick the wrong one. If you can talk to a character, that will be your only option on that scene.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ripper/ripper_049.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When you have the option to interact with a character this is done with a simple list of topics. As you progress through the game additional topics will become available for various characters depending on other interactions you’ve had with the game world. You’ll need to pay <em>extremely close</em> attention to everything everyone says as most conversations can’t be repeated and it’s easy to miss a clue or a cue that lets you know where to go next.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ripper/ripper_053.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game actually comes with a built in notebook you can use to record clues as you progress. This is an interesting mechanic, but it would be way more useful if it would record the clues for you automatically. Other than near the end of the game, unless you manually enter content into the notebook it will just remain empty.</p>

<p>This seems like a missed opportunity, as this game is very easy to get lost in which will result in a lot of backtracking and questioning everyone repeatedly to see if there are any new conversation topics. This can very quickly become tedious.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ripper/ripper_056.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though the actual gameplay of this “game” can be a bit annoying and repetitive, the acting in the cut scenes and character interactions more than make up for it. The underlying story of the game, including your pursuit of the Ripper and the backstory of the main characters, how they’re connected and how they’re all connected to the ripper murders is fantastic. I found myself rushing through the actual interactive elements of this game just so I could get the story to progress as the story is what really shines through here.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ripper/ripper_055.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Parts of this game take place in cyberspace. Your “data angel” interfaces with a list of virtual icons that lead to “wells”. These wells contain clues, story elements or software. Each well requires a password, which will either be written down somewhere or shared via a conversation. It is <em>so easy</em> to miss these passwords and get stuck, so you’ll likely find yourself referring to a walkthrough in order to progress through this game … I know I did.</p>

<p>Once you finally get into a well, chances are you’ll either be presented with a combat sequence or a puzzle. This is where the game really fell apart for me, because I fucking hated every single one of these sequences.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ripper/ripper_041.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The puzzles are brutally hard. I did not enjoy a single one of these and either looked up the solution or skipped the sequence entirely. I’m pretty sure the developers knew they were artificially padding the game with this bullshit because there’s a cheat code you can use to skip literally every puzzle or combat sequence. I’m just going to list them here (copied from <a href="https://www.cheatbook.de/files/ripper.htm">cheatbook.de</a>) in case you happen to take a run at this game after reading this review and find yourself as frustrated as I was and looking for a quick way to progress:</p>

<pre><code class="language-`">Puzzle in Catherine's Appartment      - PISCES
Catherine's Well                      - ARCADE

Warp Space puzzle                     - warp
Wofforod's Well puzzle                - vulcan
</code></pre>

<p>Just type these passwords in at the beginning of the sequence and you’ll skip it entirely.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ripper/ripper_057.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you investigate you’ll find things you can scan into your WAC, which is a portable computer/phone/database thing. Clues are stored here, and some of them can be interacted with if you find pieces of software to do so. For example, you’ll need to unlock an audio-lock at some point, so you’ll record a conversation with someone then use audio editing software to rearrange the clip into a voice key.</p>

<p>Actually as soon as the game begins Magnotta throws a cup on the ground and breaks it. You need to reassemble this in your WAC (after picking it up) to get a clue that’s written on the cup. This sequence is a pain in the ass, so you basically have 5 minutes of gameplay before the game gets in the way of the story :P</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ripper/ripper_042.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Occasionally the game will alert you that you have an incoming WAC transmission. These are used to progress the story once you’ve exhausted the various conversation topics and have analyzed and picked up everything in all available locations. When I first started playing the game I had nothing but problems with the WAC as the videos didn’t render properly. It turns out this is a problem with the game itself; not DOSBox. You need to ensure you’ve patched the game to at least <a href="https://archive.org/details/ripperpatch">version 1.05</a> as this addresses a number of video issues, so make sure you do this before you start playing.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ripper/ripper_054.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The CG in this game is sort of what you’d expect for this time period … not great. All video is also super heavily compressed so there are artifacts galore, and a low framerate as well. I honestly didn’t find it detracted too much from the experience though as the acting more than made up for the visual quality.</p>

<p>My main gripe though, was that I found myself constantly switching CDs. Yeah I know this is an old game, and FMV games typically were multi-disc, but when playing in 2023 this is frustrating enough to be worth mentioning. There are 6 discs to this game, so you’ll be prompted to switch discs pretty often.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/ripper/ripper_060.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It takes a lot of slogging, but you’ll eventually find your way to virtual White Chapel where you confront the ripper … after solving one more meaningless puzzle. So many puzzles …</p>

<p>This game would have made a good movie. As a game it sort of sucks. The puzzles are brutally hard, the actual interactive elements are sort of boring and navigating between scenes is painfully slowly and purposely drawn out. I would highly recommend reading the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ripper/">Wired article</a> about the game’s development and maybe just watching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWpWokMLyRs">longplay on YouTube</a> if you’re looking to experience <em>Ripper</em>.</p>

<p>I had extremely high hopes for this game given the A-list cast, an extremely interesting premise and story line and elements of cyberpunk, but the game fell flat. I wouldn’t recommend playing this, though it might be worth checking out clips just to experience some of the performances the actors give.</p>

<p>Picking up immediately where <a href="/blog/2023/02/18/manhunter-new-york/">Manhunter: New York</a> left off, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhunter_2:_San_Francisco">Manhunter 2: San Francisco</a> has the player crash-landing their stolen ship in the City by the Bay after trying unsuccessfully to keep up with enigmatic serial killer Phil. Left with no alternatives, the player assumes the identity of a local Manhunter and solves more crimes for the alien Orbs while searching for Phil and working for the local human resistance.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mh2/scummvm-mh2-00002.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After crash landing and killing another manhunter, your first course of action is to pick up the “Manhunter Assignment Device” (MAD) that has been conveniently dropped in plain sight (as opposed to having also been crushed by the spaceship you just crash landed). Just like the first game, the MAD is used each day to give you an outline of the movement of your targets.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mh2/scummvm-mh2-00003.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If there are multiple targets on the screen you can select them individually and trace their movements to identify additional locations within the city to investigate. Additional locations are unlocked via the MAD as you (correctly) identify suspects by searching for their names. The formula is pretty straightforward in most cases as you’ll be given a partial name (usually the first name and an initial), and later on some clue will give you the last name to fill in the blank.\</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mh2/scummvm-mh2-00020.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If after identifying someone in the MAD they have an address listed, this will be a new location you can travel to.</p>

<p>The travel mechanic in this game also mirrors that of the first game in that you get a map of San Francisco broken up into various areas with certain locations accessible for selection. Selecting any of these allows your manhunter to travel to this location to investigate, and as each day progresses new locations will be added. Since you have to backtrack occasionally, all locations remain available throughout the game once they’ve been discovered.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mh2/scummvm-mh2-00012.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game is split up into 3 days, which each require you to visit every possible area, interact with every character, pick up every piece of “evidence” possible and discover every possible suspect. Once you’ve done this you’ll get an “ORB override” on your MAD where you’ll be prompted to identify the suspects you were tracking via the MAD during that day.</p>

<p>This … can be frustrating, as if you’ve missed <em>anything</em>, the ORB override will never come and you’ll just find yourself endlessly backtracking to try and find what you may have missed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mh2/scummvm-mh2-00008.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Progress through each location is done by either investigating a static scene, or by playing through an arcade sequence (a minigame). These games can be extremely challenging, so thankfully Sierra gives you a difficulty toggle. I would highly recommend trying these at the “Normal” and “Difficult” settings first just to challenge yourself, then when you invariably fail and want to throw this game out the window, drop it down to “Easy”.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mh2/scummvm-mh2-00010.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When investigating a scene it’s pretty straightforward to identify the areas you can interact with, so you basically just need to move your cursor around until it turns into a “hand” or a “magnifying glass”. If you have the option to pick something up, do it as you’ll either need it for the day to end, or you may need it for an item combination puzzle that will make no sense.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mh2/scummvm-mh2-00027.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>At any point in the game you can view your inventory by pressing TAB. If you select any of the items in your inventory you can inspect that entry for more information … or if you happen to be on a specific scene, selecting an inventory item may use that item. This is not obvious, and can lead to a lot of frustration if you’re not trying to use every inventory item on every screen “just in case”.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mh2/scummvm-mh2-00024.png" alt="" />
<em>Use the flask here to pour the urine sample into it … you know … for reasons</em></p>

<p>For example, when you get to the doctor’s house on Day 2 and find the urine sample, instead of being able to just pick it up you’ll actually need to pour it into a flask. On this screen when you hover over the vial it just gives you an informational prompt that it’s a “urine sample”, so it’s really not obvious that you can interact with it. It’s also not obvious that you <em>should</em> put anything in the flask you got on Day 1 … so this puzzle is a huge pain in the ass.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mh2/scummvm-mh2-00026.png" alt="" />
<em>God I hated this sequence</em></p>

<p>Actually, “pain in the ass” is a good summary of this game. None of the arcade sequences are fun. The best description I can give is that they’re just tedious, and though the game is nice enough to let you restart if you die - you have to restart from the very beginning of the sequence. Some of these sequences are mazes which require a ridiculous degree of accuracy to navigate, so <em>MAKE SURE YOU SAVE OFTEN</em> … as you WILL die often.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mh2/scummvm-mh2-00025.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The art style is quite good, and you wouldn’t even know this is an AGI game. To be fair it was the last AGI title released, so the developers knew how to squeeze every bit of quality out of the engine at this point, but the engine is still dated for a title released in 1989. The sound effects are pretty basic, and though there is music on occasion, it’s PC speaker music so there’s not a lot of depth or variety.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mh2/scummvm-mh2-00034.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In the final section of the game you’re treated to a combination of a minigame + a maze. I continue to hate mazes in games, especially when you couple a maze with “touching the walls causes instant death”. This section is even worse than the awful <a href="https://screenrant.com/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-dam-level-co-creator/">underwater level in the NES version of TMNT</a>. Thankfully you can save your game at any point, so you’ll likely be saving 4-5 times per screen here as you very, very slowly progress through the maze.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/mh2/scummvm-mh2-00035.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are A LOT of things I really enjoyed about Manhunter when I played the original. Those elements definitely carried over to the sequel, but the sum of those parts didn’t really translate to an enjoyable experience. The story was pretty weak, and though you get a bit more backstory as to the ORBs, the whole thing with Phil and “the viewer” and him become the leader of the rat people is just weird and slapped together.</p>

<p>Progress through the game isn’t smooth and it’s easy to get stuck. Death waits for you around literally every corner, and though the “Game Over” screens tend to be funny and allow you to resume right before you screwed up, they occur far too frequently.</p>

<p>I’d love to play another game that uses some of these gameplay elements, but updated with some quality of life improvements and a better story to tie them all together.</p>

<p>I also don’t think I’d recommend this title to anyone at this point and likely won’t be returning to it again. If you want to check this out, maybe pick <a href="/blog/2023/02/18/manhunter-new-york/">Manhunter: New York</a> up instead as it was a bit tighter of a game.</p>

  <p>Cross posted from the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/improving-nodejs-drivers-scram-sha-256-support">MongoDB Blog</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>MongoDB always strives to offer best-in-class features, functionality, and security. A number of <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/authentication/#authentication-mechanisms">authentication mechanisms</a> currently exist to verify the identity of a connecting client to your cluster, and when using the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/security-scram/">Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM</code>)</a> there are two possible hashing functions: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-256</code>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/auth/auth.rst#defaults">MongoDB Driver Authentication Specification</a> outlines that when attempting to authenticate using SCRAM:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-256</code> is present in the list of mechanism, then it MUST be used as the default; otherwise, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-1</code> MUST be used as the default […]”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A MongoDB Server (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongos</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongod</code>) can be configured with a list of possible <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/parameters/#mongodb-parameter-param.authenticationMechanisms"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">authenticationMechanisms</code></a>. As a result, MongoDB can be configured to return new authentication mechanisms which can upgrade already running applications to more secure authentication. This is the case when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-256</code> is added to a cluster that previously only supported <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-1</code>.</p>

<p>Prior to hashing passwords with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SHA-256</code>, they will first be <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5802">prepared using SASLprep</a>. The MongoDB Node.js driver leverages an external library (<a href="https://github.com/reklatsmasters/saslprep"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">saslprep</code></a>) for this functionality, which was an <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#optionaldependencies">optional dependency</a> and only used if available. Though a number of checks were in place to ensure the library was available (and loaded), an <a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-5289">edge case was found</a> where these checks could fail and report availability incorrectly.</p>

<h2 id="potential-issue">Potential Issue</h2>

<p>Most applications won’t experience this issue, however if your Node.js project is being bundled using an alternate bundler (such as <a href="https://webpack.js.org/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">webpack</code></a>) it’s possible a variation of this issue may surface.</p>

<p>If your application was affected, it would be unable to connect to your MongoDB cluster. The stack trace from the error that would be thrown should include a call to <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/51a573fe99506b81c"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">continueScramConversation</code></a> similar to the following examples:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>{
  "errorType": "TypeError",
  "errorMessage": "saslprep is not a function",
  "stack": [
    "TypeError: saslprep is not a function",
    "    at continueScramConversation ([...]/index.js:xxx:yyy)",
    [...]
  ]
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

    at continueScramConversation (/app/webpack:[...]/mongodb/lib/core/auth/scram.js:xxx:yy)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that <a href="https://mongoosejs.com/">Mongoose</a> applications can also be affected, as Mongoose wraps the Node.js driver:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>TypeError: (0 , o.saslprep) is not a function
    at continueScramConversation (/app/webpack:[...]/mongoose/node_modules/mongodb/lib/cmap/auth/scram.js:xxx:yy)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>The underlying issue was addressed in versions <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v5.7.0">5.7.0</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v4.17.0">4.17.0</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v3.7.4">3.7.4</a> of the MongoDB Node.js driver, so depending on the version of the driver being used by your application a minor version update will address this.</p>

<p>Upgrading your application’s libraries and deploying to production may not always be possible in a timely fashion. If this is the case and you happen to hit the issue described above a workaround would be to append the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#mongodb-urioption-urioption.authMechanism"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">authMechanism</code> option</a> to your connection string with a value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-1</code> as follows:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>mongodb+srv://xyz.mongodb.net/test?authMechanism=SCRAM-SHA-1
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will force the driver to attempt authorization using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-1</code> hashing algorithm. Note that connection string changes would still require the application to be restarted for those changes to take effect.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="MongoDB" /><category term="mongodb" /><category term="drivers" /><category term="nodejs" /><category term="typescript" /><category term="javascript" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cross posted from the MongoDB Blog]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.alexbevi.com/images/mongodb-logo.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.alexbevi.com/images/mongodb-logo.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
