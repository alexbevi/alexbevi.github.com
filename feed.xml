A number of <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/authentication/#authentication-mechanisms">authentication mechanisms</a> currently exist to verify the identity of a connecting client to your cluster, and when using the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/security-scram/">Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM</code>)</a> there are two possible hashing functions: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-256</code>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/auth/auth.rst#defaults">MongoDB Driver Authentication Specification</a> outlines that when attempting to authenticate using SCRAM:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-256</code> is present in the list of mechanism, then it MUST be used as the default; otherwise, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-1</code> MUST be used as the default […]”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A MongoDB Server (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongos</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongod</code>) can be configured with a list of possible <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/parameters/#mongodb-parameter-param.authenticationMechanisms"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">authenticationMechanisms</code></a>. As a result, MongoDB can be configured to return new authentication mechanisms which can upgrade already running applications to more secure authentication. This is the case when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-256</code> is added to a cluster that previously only supported <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-1</code>.</p>

<p>Prior to hashing passwords with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SHA-256</code>, they will first be <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5802">prepared using SASLprep</a>. The MongoDB Node.js Driver leverages an external library (<a href="https://github.com/reklatsmasters/saslprep"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">saslprep</code></a>) for this functionality, which was an <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#optionaldependencies">optional dependency</a> and only used if available. Though a number of checks were in place to ensure the library was available (and loaded), an <a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-5289">edge case was found</a> where these checks could fail and report availability incorrectly.</p>

<h2 id="potential-issue">Potential Issue</h2>

<p>Most applications won’t experience this issue, however if your Node.js project is being bundled using an alternate bundler (such as <a href="https://webpack.js.org/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">webpack</code></a>) it’s possible a variation of this issue may surface.</p>

<p>If your application was affected, it would be unable to connect to your MongoDB cluster. The stack trace from the error that would be thrown should include a call to <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/51a573fe99506b81c"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">continueScramConversation</code></a></p>

<p>Note that <a href="https://mongoosejs.com/">Mongoose</a> applications can also be affected, as Mongoose wraps the Node.js driver:</p>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>The underlying issue was addressed in versions <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v5.7.0">5.7.0</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v4.17.0">4.17.0</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v3.7.4">3.7.4</a> of the MongoDB Node.js driver, so depending on the version of the Driver being used by your application a minor version update will address this.</p>

<p>Upgrading your application’s libraries and deploying to production may not always be possible in a timely fashion. If this is the case and you happen to hit the issue described above a workaround would be to append the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#mongodb-urioption-urioption.authMechanism"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">authMechanism</code> option</a> to your connection string with a value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-1</code> as follows:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>mongodb+srv://xyz.mongodb.net/test?authMechanism=SCRAM-SHA-1
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will force the driver to attempt authorization using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRAM-SHA-1</code> hashing algorithm. Note that connection string changes would still require the application to be restarted for those changes to take effect.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="MongoDB" /><category term="mongodb" /><category term="drivers" /><category term="nodejs" /><category term="typescript" /><category term="javascript" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[MongoDB always strives to offer best-in-class features, functionality, and security.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninvited_(video_game)">Uninvited</a> is a black-and-white horror-themed point-and-click adventure game. It was originally developed for the Macintosh by ICOM Simulations released in 1986 by Mindscape as part of the MacVenture series.</p>

<p>The following year, a color version of the game was released for the Amiga and Atari ST, and in 1991 for the Nintendo Entertainment System, which is the version I played for this review.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/uninvited/Uninvited 2023-08-09 06.23.04.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I’ve now played basically all the MacVentures titles for the NES because those are the versions that I personally grew up with. I really enjoy these menu-driven, story heavy adventure games that are essentially just visual novels. Though I didn’t really love <a href="/blog/2023/04/11/deja-vu/">Déjà Vu</a>, <a href="/blog/2021/08/16/shadowgate/">Shadowgate</a> remains one of my favourite game to this day.</p>

<p>As with those titles, the game screen is divided between 3 main areas: the stage (where you can see the current room), your inventory then your verb list/navigation helper. Since this is a Nintendo game you navigate the interface with the D-pad, but for the other ports you would be able to do this using a mouse.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/uninvited/13.jpg" alt="" />
<em>Screenshot lovingly borrowed from <a href="http://www.honestgamers.com/6774/amiga/uninvited/review.html">Honest Gamers’ review</a> of the Amiga port of Uninvited</em></p>

<p>Since I’m starting to get to that point in my review journey where I may not have an opportunity to play any games for certain systems, I <em>really</em> wanted to be able to play through this game on an Amiga emulator as I haven’t tackled that system yet. I tried … really I did! I got <a href="https://fs-uae.net/">FS-UAE</a> setup, but couldn’t get anything to run properly (even with the proper Kickstart ROM). I tried <a href="https://dirkwhoffmann.github.io/vAmiga/">vAmiga</a> as it looked extremely promising, but still nothing wants to work for me.</p>

<p>I snagged a screenshot from another site just to show the difference between the interfaces. I plan on completing one game for this series on the Amiga if it kills me … but Uninvited won’t be it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/uninvited/Uninvited 2023-08-09 06.24.57.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You find yourself crashed in front of a mansion. Your sister is missing, so chances are she’s inside. In you go to try and find her only to discover the house is full of ghosts and demos and a shitload of items you can pick up. As you progress you discover the house once belonged to a sorcerer with a number of apprentices. Dracan, the most talented apprentice, became corrupt and killed the other inhabitants with his magic, resulting in the house becoming haunted.</p>

<p>None of this really explains why your sister is being held captive, but whatever … ghosts and stuff.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/uninvited/Uninvited 2023-08-09 06.47.12.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Your goal is to survive long enough to find your sister. This will involve examining everything, picking up everything and trying to use everything on everything in every room and on every creature you encounter. You know might call this “playing an adventure game” … and you’d be right.</p>

<p>There are SO many things you can pick up in this game, and the vast majority of them are red herrings. Don’t forget to try and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OPEN</code> everything you pick up as well as they may contain OTHER items you can interact with. Some items (scrolls mostly) contain spells you can learn. Like Shadowgate, you’ll need to use these spells to help solve specific puzzles.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/uninvited/Uninvited 2023-08-09 06.17.16.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Most creatures you can interact with will kill you if you approach the interaction incorrectly. See that ghost lady over there? Just because you happen to have a bottle of “No Ghost” with you, remember to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OPEN</code> it first before trying to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">USE</code> it on her or that’ll be the end of you.</p>

<p>This game feels a lot bigger than Shadowgate and seems to have a lot more to do. There’s even a maze you’ll need to navigate in order to get a key item. I really dislike mazes in most games, but in this case it wasn’t overly difficult - just a bit tedious. Make sure you didn’t forget to take the pendent out of the mailbox when you first started the game … you’ll need it in the maze to scare off zombies. Oh, you forgot to pick it up …. whelp …. sucks to be you!</p>

<p>I didn’t realize I could use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TELEMAZE</code> spell to quickly exit the maze once I was done. I know in retrospect it’s pretty obvious that’s what the spell was for but I completely forgot about it …</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/uninvited/Uninvited 2023-08-09 07.00.41.png" alt="" />
<em>I’m pretty sure that’s actually the combination you need … you’re welcome</em></p>

<p>The majority of the puzzles aren’t difficult, but finding the items you need to solve a specific puzzle can be tricky. Finding the combination to the safe requires you to find a list of chemicals then find their values on the periodic table. If you know this is what you’re supposed to do it’s not too hard either, but I missed the note that had that clue on it so I resorted to a walkthrough to get past this section.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/uninvited/Uninvited 2023-08-09 07.11.48.png" alt="" />
<em>Domestic violence was apparently acceptable to Nintendo’s censors</em></p>

<p>Eventually you find your way through the mansion, find your sister, throw a goblet at the demon that was possessing her, climb out the window and win the game. Overall it’s not a bad game, though the story is pretty weak.</p>

<p>The Nintendo port of the game once again comes with a descent soundtrack (check out the track called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPu270Eoedc&amp;list=PL25CE9EE664153901&amp;index=2">“Daylight”</a> for a taste), which makes the experience of navigating the mansion a bit more enjoyable. I don’t believe the other ports have background music, so this is definitely a quality of life improvement.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/uninvited/Uninvited 2023-08-09 07.13.33.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Personally I’ve played through all these ICOM Simulations games for the Nintendo countless times as they were favourites of mine when I was a kid. I don’t have rose-coloured glasses on when it comes to the overall quality of these titles. Honestly, Uninvited is pretty derivative of Shadowgate and doesn’t really add anything new to the mix - other than the keys open multiple doors in this game (instead of it being one key per door).</p>

<p>For fans of this very specific type of menu driven adventure game I might recommend giving Uninvited a shot. If you have a hankering for this type of gameplay experience I’d recommend going back to Shadowgate instead.</p>

<p>Up until now, as opposed to returning the requested document, this family of API methods would return a <a href="https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/5.7/interfaces/ModifyResult.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ModifyResult</code></a>, which would contain the requested document in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value</code> field. This design was due to these APIs leveraging the MongoDB Server’s <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/findAndModify/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">findOneAndModify</code></a> command and wrapping the command’s <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/findAndModify/#output">output</a> directly.</p>

<p>To demonstrate, let’s adapt the code from the Driver’s documented <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/usage-examples/">usage examples</a> to update one document in our <em>movies</em> collection using the <a href="https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/5.7/classes/Collection.html#findOneAndUpdate"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">findOneAndUpdate</code></a> API.</p>

<p>One of the options we set was a <a href="https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/5.7/interfaces/FindOneAndUpdateOptions.html#returnDocument"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">returnDocument</code></a> of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">after</code>, which should return the updated document. Though the expectation may be that the function call would return the document directly, instead you would get the output above.</p>

<p>While the document you’re looking for can be accessed using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">updatedMovie.value</code>, that isn’t the most intuitive experience. But changes are on the way!</p>

<h2 id="what-can-we-do-right-now">What can we do right now?</h2>

<p>Starting with the <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v5.7.0">Node.js Driver 5.7.0</a> release, a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FindOneAnd*Options</code> property called <a href="https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/5.7/interfaces/FindOneAndUpdateOptions.html#includeResultMetadata"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">includeResultMetadata</code></a> has been introduced. When this property is set to false (default is true), the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">findOneAnd*</code> APIs will return the requested document as expected.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-typescript">What about TypeScript?</h2>

<p>If your application uses TypeScript and the MongoDB Node.js Driver, anywhere a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">findOneAnd*</code> call is made, if the requested document is required it will be accessed via the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value</code> property of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ModifyResult</code>. This occurs when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">includeResultMetadata</code> is not set or when it is set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> (the current default value).</p>

<p><img src="/images/product1605-02.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Type hinting will indicate the Schema associated with the collection that the operation was executed against. As we would expect, when the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">includeResultMetadata</code> is changed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code>, inline validation will indicate there’s an issue since the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value</code> property no longer exists on the type associated with the result</p>

<p><img src="/images/product1605-01.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Attempting to compile our TypeScript project will also fail.</p>

<p>This makes it incredibly easy to identify where in the code changes need to be made.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>If you’re using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">findOneAnd*</code> family of APIs in your JavaScript or TypeScript project, upgrading the MongoDB Node.js Driver to 5.7.0+ and adding the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">includeResultMetadata: false</code> option to those API calls will allow you to adapt your application to the new behavior prior to the 6.0.0 release.</p>

<p>Once 6.0.0 is released, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">includeResultMetadata: false</code> will become the default behavior. If your application relies on the previous behavior of these APIs, setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">includeResultMetadata: true</code> will allow you to continue to access the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ModifyResult</code> directly.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="MongoDB" /><category term="mongodb" /><category term="drivers" /><category term="nodejs" /><category term="typescript" /><category term="javascript" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cross posted from the MongoDB Blog]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.alexbevi.com/images/mongodb-logo.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.alexbevi.com/images/mongodb-logo.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Tony Tough and the Night of Roasted Moths (Nayma Software, Prograph Research S.r.l.) - 1999</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2023/07/31/tony-tough/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tony Tough and the Night of Roasted Moths (Nayma Software, Prograph Research S.r.l.) - 1999" /><published>2023-07-31T06:36:30-04:00</published><updated>2023-08-11T06:04:54-04:00</updated><id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2023/07/31/tony-tough</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2023/07/31/tony-tough/"><![CDATA[<blockquote class="prompt-info">

<p>A dastardly alien is stealing all of the children’s Halloween candy! Tony Tough P.I. will not stand for this. He sets out to stop the fiend before it’s too late, and the alien takes over the world! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Tough_and_the_Night_of_Roasted_Moths">Tony Tough and the Night of Roasted Moths</a> is a traditional 2D “point and click” adventure with a crazy story. The humor and style are reminiscent of old LucasArts games, like Day of the Tentacle.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/tony/scummvm-tony-00020.png" alt="" />
<em>That’s probably not racist … right?</em></p>

<p>For a game that was developed originally by an Italian team (and likely written in Italian then localized), it is extremely clever, nuanced and funny. I have had this title on my radar for over a decade - basically since it was added to <a href="https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Tony_Tough_and_the_Night_of_Roasted_Moths">ScummVM in 1.6.0</a>. At that time one of the original developers <a href="/blog/2012/11/02/developer-braindump-tony-tough-and-the-night-of-the-roasted-moths/">provided a braindump</a> of their memories of making the game, which I found informative and fascinating.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/tony/scummvm-tony-00000.png" alt="" />
<em>I’m guessing this will affect the puzzles (like in Curse of Monkey Island)</em></p>

<p>It’s clear the developers took a lot of inspiration from LucasArts as this game unfolds, plays and reads like a Monkey Island, Full Throttle or Sam and Max title. Interactions with the world and other characters is done with a single click that spawns a pictograph that you use to select an action (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TALK</code>,<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">USE</code>,<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TAKE</code>,<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code>, etc), and literally everything you can interact with rewards you with a smart ass response.</p>

<p>The plot is kind of thin as you start off learning that halloween candy is being stolen - and since you’re a private eye (for some reason) you decide to investigate. As soon as you start off your pet Tapir (I thought it was a dog) is kidnapped and you’re left with a ransom note. From here you start working your way through the first of 3 “levels” in this game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/tony/scummvm-tony-00005.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Getting out of the first level introduces you to your first of many, Many, MANY fetch quests and item combination puzzles. In order to get access to the second “level” you need to get past the old lady at the entrance by … dressing like a girl. This requires a smock, a scarf, a wig, a flower and a bag of candy. Sounds a bit convoluted right … like you’re making a sasquatch costume in <a href="/blog/2023/01/23/sam-and-max-hit-the-road/">Sam and Max</a>?</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/tony/scummvm-tony-00015.png" alt="" />
<em>You’ll be SO happy you have this map … trust me!</em></p>

<p>Once you reach the amusement part (second level) Tony will begin to draw a map as you explore. This can be used to fast travel around, which is a huge time saver. Since this game is just a massive series of fetch quests that involve endless backtracking, quality of life improvements like this map are greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/tony/scummvm-tony-00021.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Getting out of the second level requires you to retrieve all the ingredients the fortune teller needs to concoct something that will help him see where you need to go next. This involves fetching those ingredients, but each ingredient is a combination of items you find throughout the park - so it’s a fetch quest within a fetch quest: FETCHQUESTCEPTION!!!!</p>

<p>Though it may be a bit tedious, figuring out what all the items you need are isn’t overly complicated as you can ask any number of NPCs throughout the park about pretty much anything - and the clues they give you (though cryptic at times) tend to point you in the right direction. Personally I found this to be a sign of excellent planning by the developers as they clearly wanted this to be challenging, but approachable (and winnable).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/tony/scummvm-tony-00016.png" alt="" />
<em>Talk to EVERYONE about EVERYTHING!</em></p>

<p>Conversations are basic dialog trees, so nothing groundbreaking here. You’ll need to backtrack a lot as you proceed since new dialog options will appear for most NPCs as task are completed or new areas are unlocked. Pretty much every interaction you have with anyone (or anything) has Tony dropping some witty quip or sarcastic remark, so though it may be a bit tedious it’s at least entertaining.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/tony/scummvm-tony-00006.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The LucasArts influence persists throughout this game, right down to the interaction menu being cribbed from games like <a href="/blog/2023/03/10/full-throttle/">Full Throttle</a>. It’s a good design choice and works well for the game, but for a game this late in our journey it comes across as derivative.</p>

<p>It’s hard to fault Tony Tough for feeling like a LucasArts knock-off as it’s done extremely well and really plays more as an ode to the adventure games that clearly inspired it than as a knock-off.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/tony/scummvm-tony-00032.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Tony Tough and the Night of Roasted Moths</em> is a lot of fun to play mainly due to the dry comedic style of writing that permeates all character interactions and Tony’s observations. The game is visually appealing, and clearly took a page out of the LucasArts book of point-and-click adventure game design.</p>

<p>There was a sequel (<a href="https://www.tony-tough.com/en/tony-tough-a-rakes-progress">Tony Tough™ in A Rake’s Progress</a>) which I won’t be covering during this series but am definitely curious to try out one day. The developers are also working on <a href="https://www.tony-tough.com/en/tony-tough-and-the-army-of-dorkiness">The Army Of Dorkiness Project</a> which is meant to bring Tony Tough back for a third time.</p>

<p>I would recommend this title to anyone looking for a game similar to the later LucasArts adventure games.</p>

For example, MongoDB Atlas - depending on the selected tier - will impose a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/atlas-limits/#connection-limits-and-cluster-tier">connection limit</a>.</p>

<p>Depending on the architecture of your application and how you’ve configured your <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/connection-pool-overview/">connection pools</a> it’s possible you’ve approached or exceeded these limits before and weren’t really sure why. Thankfully MongoDB Atlas provides a number of configurable alerts (such as <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/alert-conditions/#mongodb-alert-Connections---of-configured-limit-is"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Connections % of configured limit</code></a>) which can notify you if you’re approaching a limit, but where are these connections coming from in the first place?</p>

<h2 id="mongodb-drivers">MongoDB Drivers</h2>

<p>Your application has been built using one of <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/">MongoDB’s Drivers</a>, which are all built according to a number of <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications">published specifications</a>. Most noteworthy when it comes to how many connections an application may establish to a MongoDB cluster are the <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-monitoring.rst">Server Monitoring</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/connection-monitoring-and-pooling/connection-monitoring-and-pooling.rst">Connection Monitoring and Pooling</a> (CMAP) specifications.</p>

<p>These specifications help us understand how many connections may be opened, and what variables we should be aware of that can affect these connections such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is the MongoClient single-threaded or multi-threaded</li>
  <li>The MongoDB Server version (&gt;= 4.4)</li>
  <li>The MongoDB Driver version (does it support MongoDB Server 4.4+)</li>
</ul>

<p>Just a quick note regarding <em>Connection Pools</em>: the default value of <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/connection-monitoring-and-pooling/connection-monitoring-and-pooling.rst#id1"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minPoolSize</code></a> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>, which means that using the defaults when a <em>Connection Pool</em> is created it will not contain any connections. For the purposes of this article I imply that at least one connection has been created in the pool and ready for use.</p>

<h3 id="single-threaded-mongoclient">Single-Threaded <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MongoClient</code></h3>

<p>The MongoDB <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/c/">C Driver</a> and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/php/">PHP Driver</a> provide single-threaded <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MongoClient</code> implementations. As such, they do not offer connection pools at all which makes understanding how many connections can be established straightforward<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/mongo-conns-01.png" alt="" />
<em>Connections from a Single Threaded <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MongoClient</code></em></p>

<p>With this configuration, a single connection (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">c1</code>) will be established to each <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/replica-set-members/">replica set member</a>, or if the cluster is <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/sharding/">Sharded</a> each <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/sharded-cluster-query-router/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongos</code></a> present in the seed list when the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MongoClient</code> was created<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. This single connection will be used for data operations as well as to perform <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-monitoring.rst#single-threaded-monitoring">server monitoring</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="prompt-tip">

<h3 id="mongodb-server-42-and-earlier-polling-monitoring">MongoDB Server 4.2 and earlier (Polling Monitoring)</h3>

<p>Prior to MongoDB 4.4, MongoDB Drivers would use a <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-monitoring.rst#polling-protocol">polling protocol to perform server monitoring</a>. This process would involve opening a dedicated <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-monitoring.rst#monitor-thread">monitor thread</a> per host, which would be polled (by default<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>) every 10 seconds (multi-threaded) or 60 seconds (single-threaded) to determine if the state of the host or cluster topology had changed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/mongo-conns-02.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This dedicated monitor thread (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m1</code>) as well as a the 1 or more connections in the connection pool (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">p1</code>) result in at least 2 connections per host. Note that if <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#mongodb-urioption-urioption.minPoolSize"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minPoolSize</code></a> (default: 0) is &gt; 1 this number of connections will <em>always</em> remain open against each host a connection pool has been created for.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="mongodb-server-44-and-later-streaming-monitoring">MongoDB Server 4.4 and later (Streaming Monitoring)</h3>

<p>Starting with MongoDB 4.4, MongoDB Drivers would begin using a <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-monitoring.rst#streaming-protocol">streaming protocol to perform server monitoring</a> - assuming those Drivers were compatible with MongoDB 4.4. The goal of this new protocol was to ensure connected applications could discover topology changes in as close to realtime as possible.</p>

<p>As the polling protocol only polled at fixed intervals, it was possible for topology changes to go undiscovered for upwards of 10 seconds. The streaming protocol would “push” updates from the server to the clients, as opposed to the previous “pull” model, which allowed applications to update their view of the cluster far more quickly.</p>

<p><img src="/images/mongo-conns-03.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Similar to the polling protocol, a dedicated monitor thread (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m1</code>) will be opened per host, as well as 1 or more connections in the connection pool (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">p1</code>). Further to these connections though a third connection (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">r1</code>) is opened per node for <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-monitoring.rst#measuring-rtt">measuring RTT</a> (round trip time). This is needed as the monitor thread is open and listening once established, and will only receive updates from the server as they occur. Measuring RTT require the measurement of the time taken for an operation to travel from the client to the server and back, which the streaming monitor no longer provides.</p>

<blockquote class="prompt-info">
  <p>Assuming a cluster with 3 nodes, each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MongoClient</code> instance would create 9 connections.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="prompt-tip">
  <p>If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minPoolSize=5</code> then each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MongoClient</code> would create 21 connections (using the formula <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(minPoolSize + 2) x nodes</code>)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="what-if-im-using-aws-lambda">What if I’m using AWS Lambda?</h2>

<p>Depending on your application’s architecture, it’s possible to blow past your connection limits pretty quickly. This is one reason why the documented guidance for <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/manage-connections-aws-lambda/">managing connections with AWS Lambda</a> has the first bullet point of <em>“Define the client to the MongoDB server outside the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-prog-model-handler.html">AWS Lambda handler function</a>“</em>.</p>

<p>If each Lambda function were to connect to a MongoDB 4.4+ cluster using a connection string of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongodb+srv://xxx.mongodb.net/?minPoolSize=5</code> and the cluster only had 3000 connections configured, within 150 near-concurrent function executions the cluster could potentially reach the connection limit! This is obviously an extreme scenario, but is meant to help illustrate the impact creating many <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MongoClient</code> instances can potentially have on your cluster.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snatcher_(video_game)">Snatcher</a> is a cyberpunk graphic adventure game developed and published by Konami. It was written and designed by Hideo Kojima and first released in 1988 for the PC-8801 and MSX2 in Japan. Snatcher is set in a future East Asian metropolis where humanoid robots dubbed “Snatchers” have been discovered killing humans and replacing them in society.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/snatcher/Snatcher 2023-06-21 06.35.37.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game follows Gillian Seed, an amnesiac who joins an anti-Snatcher agency in search of his past. Gameplay takes place primarily through a menu-based interface through which the player can choose to examine items, search rooms, speak to characters, explore a semi-open world, and perform other actions.</p>

<p>Part of the fun for me in playing these games is getting to mess around with new emulators. I’m using an old MacBook Pro to play most of these games, so I figured I’d give <a href="http://openemu.org/">OpenEmu</a> a try since I have a couple Sega CD games on my list and this emulator is only available for OSX.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/snatcher/iScreen Shoter - OpenEmu - 230628053228.png" alt="" />
<em>OMG! Play time recording!!!</em></p>

<p>Typically I’d play console games on Android using <a href="https://www.explusalpha.com/">Ex Plus Alpha</a> (which I did for <a href="/blog/2021/08/16/shadowgate/">Shadowgate</a>). I’ve bought all the emulators (NES.emu, SNES.emu, etc) and have been using them for years, but one features I’ve really wanted was the ability to record playtime. I went so far as to open <a href="https://github.com/Rakashazi/emu-ex-plus-alpha/issues/37">an issue in GitHub</a> for it in 2015, but this never got any traction.</p>

<p>OpenEmu appears to support this out of the box, which was a very pleasant surprise. Furthermore you can easily remap the keys for quick save/load, fast forward, rewind and taking a screenshot which I found extremely convenient. I will most likely be using OpenEmu for any future games that it supports as I find the interface and experience a lot better than other multi-emulator systems (such as <a href="https://www.retroarch.com/">RetroArch</a>).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/snatcher/Snatcher 2023-06-21 11.32.37.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Similar to ICOM Simulations type games, Snatcher is predominantly a visual novel. You’re presented with a number of actions you can perform on each static screen that allow you to learn more about your surroundings or interact with a character. You’ll find yourself having to go through the motions of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code>ing at everything available, then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INVESTIGATE</code>-ing everything you just looked at, then repeating because you may have uncovered new options to perform these 2 actions on.</p>

<p>It felt a little redundant initially, then as the game dragged on it actually detracted from the experience. I understand the intent of the selected verbs and how they’re supposed to differ, but from a game design perspective it’s not really adding anything meaningful.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/snatcher/Snatcher 2023-06-26 11.42.16.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The version of the game I played had most character interactions fully voice acted. You’d be presented with a view of the scene that took up about 70% of the screen, with the lower third split into three square where character portraits could be displayed. These portraits would be slightly animated as the characters were speaking so you’d know who was talking, and honestly the voice acting for every character was pretty good.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/snatcher/Snatcher 2023-06-21 11.33.31.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This game is for a mature audience, as there are multiple scenes that some players might find a bit more gory than they might like. As the story unfolds, you’re investigating the murder of one of your fellow Junkers. In this world, the Junkers are sort of like “blade runners” that are tasked with hunting down Snatchers (which if you’re familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner">Blade Runner</a> are just replicants).</p>

<p>You progress the story by traveling from location to location, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MOVE</code>-ing about and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code>ing/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INVESTIGATE</code>-ing everything. Depending on where you are and what you’ve just interacted with, you may uncover some evidence. When this happens, you’ll call it out with a closeup of the item in question which will then be added to your inventory.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/snatcher/Snatcher 2023-06-21 19.21.48.png" alt="" />
<em>Whatever this is I should probably hold onto it</em></p>

<p>Gillian acquires a limited number of inventory items throughout the game that can be used during character interactions (ex: money, Junker ID) but most of the items you find throughout the game are considered evidence. Both evidence and items can be used on characters you’re talking to, and you’ll likely find yourself trying literally everything on everyone to see what will work.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/snatcher/Snatcher 2023-06-26 11.56.45.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Throughout the game you’re accompanied by a robot companion named “Metal Gear”. By interacting with him you’re able to save your game, make video phone calls and perform certain environment interactions (like scanning for SNOW-9, scanning for movement or if it’s dark turning on a light). Metal Gear will also nudge you along with some hints as to where you should go next or what you might want to try on a certain screen.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/snatcher/Snatcher 2023-06-23 06.20.06.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Aside from the usual “go from screen to screen mashing through all menu options”, there are a handful of puzzles you’ll need to complete. At one point you need to create a reconstruction of a suspect based on the descriptions provided by someone you interview. This is … painful. Technically you could just keep trying all possible combinations until you get it right but that will take <em>forever</em>! This was very much a section I relied on the walkthrough for.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/snatcher/Snatcher 2023-06-21 19.11.02.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Unlike visual novel style games, Snatcher also includes arcade sequences. These areas involve having to move the cursor around the screen and shooting robots before they shoot back. Honestly they’re not too challenging, and if you happen to die the game lets you resume at the screen before the sequence began. This is beneficial as I forgot to save for a while when I got to this first section and got myself killed pretty quickly :P</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/snatcher/Snatcher 2023-06-23 05.17.26.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The content of this game is much more mature, and Gillian has conversation options to basically hit on every woman you meet. Apparently the Sega CD release censors some of the graphics and removes some of these options, but there’s enough in there to give you a good idea as to what kind of a guy the main character is.</p>

<p>A lot of these conversation options are hidden until you <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INVESTIGATE</code> the same option multiple times (sometimes a few dozen times).</p>

<p>This is actually one of my biggest complaints about this game. There are too many sequences that won’t advance until you repeat the same option many times until a new selection becomes available in the menu. Often the feedback you get from Gillian or Metal Gear will be the same for many of those selections so it’s not obvious that they’re waiting for you to keep repeating the option.</p>

<p>Overall this game was a pleasant surprise. The story is really compelling and well structured, and though it can be challenging to get it to progress in certain areas, it’s generally an intuitive game to play.</p>

<p>I’m a huge fan of cyberpunk in general, and I like visual novels and menu driven games so Snatcher sort of hit a number of gaming sweet spots for me. The music is atmospheric and adds to the experience nicely, and the voice acting quality was better than I would have expected.</p>

<p>For anyone looking for a story that feels like it’s in the Blade Runner universe, look no further than Snatcher.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Knight:_Sins_of_the_Fathers">Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers</a> is a 1993 point-and-click adventure game, developed and published by Sierra On-Line for MS-DOS, Macintosh, and Windows, and released on December 17, 1993. The CD-ROM version features the voice talents of Tim Curry, Mark Hamill, Michael Dorn, Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., and Leah Remini. The game’s story focuses on Gabriel Knight, a struggling novelist and owner of a rare book store in New Orleans, who opts to research a recent spate of murders around the city that have a connection to voodoo. In the process, he is slowly revealed to be a descendant of a German family who are involved in combatting people who use supernatural forces, and discovers a link between the killings and his family’s past.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gk1/scummvm-gk1-cd-win-00048.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>First off, I love the darker and more mature theme of this game. While investigating the murder (“for his book”), Gabriel has access to crime scenes and evidence as his friend Detective Mosley believes it’s just research. Mosley thinks Gabriel is going to include him as a character, so he gives him a lot more access than he likely should have.</p>

<p>Several key story points trigger cut scenes that are presented as multi-panel art boxes. As this gives the game a Graphic Novel feel I actually like it a lot more than if they resorted to FMVs or scripted events.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gk1/scummvm-gk1-cd-win-00011.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You move around the French Quarter of New Orleans via a quick travel map, with additional locations being added as you advance the story. There really aren’t too many locations in this game, with several only being visited once. When you move to the greater New Orleans map, there are a couple more locations you have access to, but overall the game keeps you focused on a dozen or less areas you need to return to.</p>

<p>This makes the game feel a lot bigger than it actually is, but not overwhelming as you will need to backtrack to a number of these key locations as you uncover new dialogue options that you’ll then need to try out on every character you’ve spoken to already.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gk1/scummvm-gk1-cd-win-00003.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Character interactions are all presented on a static screen with various topics you can ask. Every character gets the the same key topics, with some character-specific topics also presented to help flesh out their backgrounds and motivations. These are actually colour-coded which is a nice quality of life feature to help you identify when you’ve surfaced a keyword you should likely go ask others about.</p>

<p>If you’re playing the CD version of the game, all interactions are voiced by professional actors and it really shows in the quality of the delivery. Tim Curry’s performance as Gabriel Knight really draws you into the story. Though this game was remade for the <a href="https://www.postudios.com/company/games/gabrielknight20th/">20th Anniversary by Phoenix Online Studios</a> I don’t know that I’d have enjoyed it nearly as much with a different cast.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gk1/scummvm-gk1-cd-win-00034.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The theme of underground cartels, secret organizations and voodoo is ever present throughout this game and most game scenes represent this extremely well. Though this is still an SCI game using pixel art, it is very expressive and stays true to the darker content and themes of the game.</p>

<p>To really draw you in the soundtrack also fits perfectly and further draws you into the overall experience. Sierra Music Central has the <a href="http://www.sierramusiccentral.com/gk1cd.html">full soundtrack</a> available for free if you want to check out any tracks. My personal favourite would be the <a href="http://www.sierramusiccentral.com/musics/gk1cd/GK1Track05.mp3">theme to St. George’s Bookshop</a> - go ahead, give it a listen.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gk1/scummvm-gk1-cd-win-00001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The game takes place over the course of 10 days, with the story progressing in a linear fashion. Each day you have a certain number of key events you need to complete in order to progress, and you’ll know you’ve finished these because Gabriel will indicate it’s getting late and time to head home. Though the game is very well structured and if you exhaust all the dialogue options available with each character each day you shouldn’t get stuck, I found myself unable to progress past day 4 for longer than I care to admit.</p>

<p>After doing a bit of hunting around online for the solution, apparently <a href="https://www.neoseeker.com/forums/1378/t225489-day-4-won-end/">others have hit the same roadblock</a> so I felt a little less stupid needing to look for help. Turns out I needed to go to Moonbeam and show her the markings from the tomb you copied earlier using the sketchbook (which teaches you about the Rada drums I believe).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gk1/scummvm-gk1-cd-win-00031.png" alt="" />
<em>It takes a bit of patience, but the pattern matching puzzles aren’t too difficult</em></p>

<p>There are a few instances in this game where you’ll need to work with the Rada drums in order to either decode or send message. Initially I thought this was going to be tedious, but it was relatively well done and you weren’t presented with a ridiculous number of useless options you’d need to wade through in order to match the right patterns.</p>

<p>As long as you’re paying attention to the clues the game is giving you it’s not too difficult to figure out what the message is you’re supposed to write on the tomb with the brick either. Thankfully the game will tell you right away if it’s the wrong message when you exit the screen so you’re not just blindly waiting for some scripted event to occur that’s never going to happen.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gk1/scummvm-gk1-cd-win-00006.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Since this is a Sierra SCI game the top of the screen hides the menu bar, which is a bit more involved than most of the Quest series. The typical action icons exist (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOOK</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TALK</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WALK</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TAKE</code>, etc) and you can access your inventory, but there’s also an option for the tape recorder. Since Gabriel is an author and is interviewing people for his book, he’s recording all conversations for future reference.</p>

<p>This is extremely useful as you can revisit every conversation you’ve had and review what topics were discussed and what the answers were. For those of us that don’t write everything down but wonder on occasion “what did XXX say about YYY?”, this is an invaluable tool.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gk1/scummvm-gk1-cd-win-00046.png" alt="" />
<em>These zombies will fuck you up</em></p>

<p>Certain situations Gabriel finds himself in can lead to death and a game over. This is not unexpected in a Sierra Online game, but it was refreshing to find that these were rare occurrences, and were somewhat expected. I’m not sure if there are any game-ending deaths earlier in the game, but later when you’re trying to get out of Snake Mound and you wake the zombies, if one of them catches you they’ll make quick work of you.</p>

<p>When you finally find the voodoo honfour, if you summon Brother Eagle but don’t get out of the hallway in time, he’ll catch and kill you.</p>

<p>Like most Sierra Online games, this game has a speed toggle in the settings - which you’ll likely want to increase as Gabriel walks pretty slowly. I’m guessing speeding up the game likely wouldn’t only affect his walk speed though so it probably wouldn’t help you in these situations.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/gk1/scummvm-gk1-cd-win-00051.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Sins of the Fathers is one of my all time favourite adventure games. The story is just fantastic and keeps you drawn in until the very end. The pacing is spot on and though some of the puzzles can be a bit difficult, nothing you do feels like busy work to pad out the game.</p>

<p>There really aren’t a lot of locations you need to visit, so backtracking is less of a chore, and if you missed something or forgot to ask someone something it doesn’t take long to fill that gap to advance the plot. I also didn’t find there were any unwinnable situations as I don’t believe a given day will end unless you’ve done everything and picked up everything that’s required.</p>

<p>This is a title I would highly recommend to anyone interested in adventure gaming. Do yourself a favour though and play this game on ScummVM with <a href="https://docs.scummvm.org/en/v2.6.1/advanced_topics/understand_audio.html#what-is-mt-32">MT-32 device emulation</a>. It makes an already awesome soundtrack all that much more awesome!</p>

<p>I never finished either of the sequels, though I did try them and was disappointed so not looking forward to having to slog through those when the time comes. For now though I’m still basking in a great gaming experience.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torin%27s_Passage">Torin’s Passage</a> is a point-and-click adventure game developed and published by Sierra On-Line in 1995. The game was designed by Al Lowe, author of the Leisure Suit Larry series.</p>

<p>The game starts off with some royalty being killed by a wizard and what you assume is the royal baby being saved by a maid or something. She saves Torin, but is punished for this good deed by being shackled with a collar that keeps slowly tightening until it will eventually kill her. I think she then becomes evil or something and teams up with the wizard that killed the royal family, but honestly I sort of spaced out pretty quickly.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/torin/scummvm-torin-00001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>My main issue with this game was the story comes off as a generic fantasy crammed full of tropes but laid out in what feels like the laziest way possible. Torin grows up with farmers as his adopted parents, something happens, an evil sorceress captures your adopted family and you then need to go save them. This is done by traveling to the “lands below” by throwing magic powder at crystals that send you deeper and deeper into the earth.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/torin/scummvm-torin-00019.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Each chapter of the game represents your descent through the layers of the world as you slowly work your way to the core where your parents may be. This is done by completing fetch quest after fetch quest, solving a handful of puzzles and constantly backtracking.</p>

<p>This is pretty standard fare for a lot of adventure games, but everything in this game just sort of feels forced and a bit sloppy. I get that Al Lowe wanted to write a game that he could play with his young daughter, but the game he wrote seemed to just be a rip off of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Framed_Roger_Rabbit">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a> and King’s Quest VII.</p>

<em>Maybe I’m being too critical, but the game just looks like shit</em></p>

<p>Adding insult to injury, the game just doesn’t look that good. For a game that came out in late 1995 I really expected a lot more. The UI is bland and takes up the lower third of the screen. Your inventory is always visible, and you can take any item in your inventory and put it on the center pedestal to “zoom in” and examine the items. Very few items are worth doing this with, and when you do the “lasers” (green circle things) on each side of the inventory shoot it for some reason.</p>

<p>Just look at it. If this were a game from the mid 80’s I’d be a lot more forgiving, but again … this is 1995 and Sierra has made a LOT of much MUCH better games. Weirdly enough the visual style of this game reminded more of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link:_The_Faces_of_Evil_and_Zelda:_The_Wand_of_Gamelon">CD-i Zelda games</a> more than anything else. Google some pictures from those games and tell me you don’t see it ;)</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/torin/scummvm-torin-00020.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I mentioned this game reminded me of Roger Rabbit because you’ve got a sidekick throughout named Boogle that seems to provide the exact same style of comic relief. Sometimes it’s even identical (they lifted some lines and scenarios directly from the movie).</p>

<p>The Boogle character at least adds a bit of variety to the game as he can transform into things you can use to solve certain puzzles. Typically you’ll use each Boogle form exactly once though, so the amount of variety it adds is limited.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/torin/scummvm-torin-00034.png" alt="" />
<em>Oh god … puns … so many puns</em></p>

<p>Unlike the Leisure Suit Larry games though, Torin’s Passage isn’t very funny - or for that matter, fun. From the time you start playing until the time you finally decide you’ve had enough and are ready to move on to a better game you’ll just feel like you’re going through the motions of playing a game.</p>

<p>I just didn’t find the writing to be all that compelling - and I am a fan of Al Lowe (including following him on <a href="https://twitter.com/allowe">Twitter</a>). I’m not sure how actively involved he was in the actual content generation (since he was the director), but the game just felt derivative and slapped together.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/torin/scummvm-torin-00027.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>What I did find a bit innovative was the built in hint system. You have a hint timer that you can configure, which after elapsing allows you to get a hint on how to proceed. If you’re newer to the genre this might come in handy as some of the puzzles are a bit obtuse and overly complex.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/torin/scummvm-torin-00021.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are a couple puzzles at the end of Chapter 4 (I think that’s the right chapter) where you need to move these miniature dudes around in order to unlock (something). The whole “harmony” concept means you need to shuffle them around until you align them by colour, but which colours go where is not immediately obvious.</p>

<p>Once you finally solve this (likely with a walkthrough), you’ll then have to do basically the same fucking puzzle but instead by rotating 2 characters at a time to get them in descending orders. This took FOREVER, and was NOT FUN. I really, REALLY hate arbitrary puzzles that feel like padding. I don’t have a problem with challenging puzzles, especially if it feels like you’ve gained the tools to solve the puzzle by naturally playing the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/torin/scummvm-torin-00039.png" alt="" />
<em>No ending - just credits</em></p>

<p>When you finally muddle your way to the finale, the game just sort of ends (cuts to credits). Apparently this is because Al Lowe planned for Torin’s Passage to be the first of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010128170800/http://larry.adventuregamer.com/allinterview.html">5 games in a series</a>. Obviously this never came to pass, and it’s likely because this game just wasn’t all that good.</p>

<p>Sierra Online made so many better games before this title came out, so it’s extremely disappointing to have to trudge through this turd. Boogle could have been a game changer if they’d incorporated him more deeply into the plot (or bothered to introduce him at all). The mechanic of having horizontal and vertical sliders so you can pan around a larger scene without having to walk around was interesting, but again, this wasn’t introduced. When you needed to actually use this panning mechanic to solve a puzzle it wasn’t obvious that this was how you approach the solution.</p>

<p>I would not recommend this title to anyone. It’s just not fun, or interesting, or innovative in any way. Some component pieces had promise and might have (or possible DID) work better in other games, but Torin’s Passage isn’t worth anyone’s time today.</p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Return_to_Ringworld">Return to Ringworld</a> is the sequel to the previous game based on Larry Niven’s “Known Space” series of novels (Ringworld). Once again this game is a point and click adventure/puzzle solving game.</p>

<p>After saving the puppeteer race from extermination and uncovering some powerful ancient technology on the first game, Quinn, Seeker of Vengeance and Miranda Rees find themselves searched as fugitives by all three major species, so they go to Ringworld to hide. Once in Ringworld they’ll try to uncover some evidence to clear their names, but they stumble across another universe-threatening plot. This time U.N. general Carson Teal is out to rule the universe by uncovering Ringworld’s secrets, and you must stop him.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/r2rw/r2rw_017.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This game is way, WAY bigger than it’s predecessor, with hundreds of screens, mazes, etc. Plus you get to play as all three characters throughout the game, a la Day of the Tentacle. This is actually a big part of the game this time around once you get going as the story progresses from the vantage point of each character. Miranda is on the ship for most of the game, but Quinn and Seeker head out together to explore the Ringworld - typically to navigate their way through some form of maze …</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/r2rw/r2rw_013.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Return to Ringworld is basically just a series of mazes … and I fucking hate mazes in adventure games. They needlessly delay story progression and feel bolted on to artificially inflate the time it takes to finish the game. Don’t get me wrong, if I’m playing an RPG I <em>expect</em> there to be dungeons (mazes) I need to map in order to progress, find items, fight monsters, gain experience and so on … but I find it frustrating in adventure games.</p>

<p>You have a comm unit that acts as a navigation tool for some of these mazes, but for others you need to draw maps to keep track of where you’ve been, where you’re going and where key items are located. Again, if this were an RPG … cool … but I know it’s just bloating a fetch quest.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/r2rw/r2rw_021.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>One task Seeker needs to complete in order to get a balloon to escape the spill mountains (I think it was here) is to rid them of a vampire problem by first completing a series of fetch quests to build a breathing mask to prevent the vampire pheromones from driving Seeker mad, then navigating a giant maze to hunt down all vampires and exterminate them. This section of the game honestly felt like it took the majority of my play time as it involved endless backtracking to hunt down these vampires and kill them. You have no indication as to how many you need to kill other than a message that gets displayed when you finally kill them all.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/r2rw/r2rw_022.png" alt="" />
<em>I guess I got them all. FINALLY!</em></p>

<p>Though the game is much bigger than its predecessor <a href="/blog/2022/12/19/ringworld/">Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch</a>, I found there were some serious detractors from the experience. First of all, the walk speeds are abysmally slow. I know I can play this game on ScummVM, but I chose to play on DOSBox-X instead because I could crank the CPU cycles to Turbo whenever navigating one of the many, many mazes.</p>

<p>Second, though they’re not badly done, there are far too many drawn out cut scenes.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/r2rw/r2rw_029.png" alt="" />
<em>Pretty, but how long do I have to sit here and watch this animation</em></p>

<p>I think the Tsunami artists focused a little too heavily on the filler and too little on the gameplay.</p>

<p>Since this is an adventure game, the story is central to the experience, and in this case it did not disappoint. The character interactions were interesting, the story progressed in a linear fashion and kept me engaged and I looked forward to seeing where it would take me next.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/r2rw/r2rw_011.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Character interactions will either follow the typical linear progression or offer you a dialogue tree you can follow. The conversations are well written and they do a good job of injecting a lot of elements from the books such as characters, locations, historic events, species and slang (TANJ!). Since I really enjoyed these books as a teenager the settings you were dropped into and the elements of the world you engaged with felt natural.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/r2rw/r2rw_009.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Background music and sound effects were limited, but present. The music in general mostly felt generic, but I appreciated that it was there as my characters waded through all the mazes (yes, here I go again with the mazes!). All character dialogue is voice acted, and honestly they did a pretty good job of it. I ended up disabling speech and going with just text as I could read faster than the actors could deliver the lines. This is one game that offered support for the Roland MT-32, so if playing in ScummVM or DOSBox you can emulate this interface for some better synthesized tunes (check out a sample <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rajzeyau-Lo">of the intro sequence</a>).</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/r2rw/r2rw_031.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you make your way through the final maze and defeat Teal by letting a Ghoul get him, you escape to a location that appears to be off the Ringworld. Where did you end up? Maybe we’ll find out in a sequel? Turns out … no, because Tsunami only made these 2 titles. I really did enjoy the story, even if playing the game seemed to get in the way occasionally. If you, like me, made it this far and still hunger for more Ringworld lore, check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringworld_series">series of books</a>. I guarantee they’ll quench your thirst for Sci-Fi goodness!</p>

<p>As for this game, I’d recommend maybe passing it by. <a href="/blog/2022/12/19/ringworld/">Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch</a> felt like a tighter package and game play experience, which if you’re looking for a quick virtual romp through the Ringworld is likely the better choice.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companions_of_Xanth">Companions of Xanth</a> is based on Piers Anthony’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanth">Xanth novels</a> and loosely follows the plot of his 1993 novel <em>Demons Don’t Dream</em>, in which a young man uses a computer game to enter and explore the world of Xanth.</p>

<p>Typical of Piers Anthony’s novels, the game is filled with puns and visual gags, and some knowledge of the Xanth universe is helpful; for those players who haven’t read any of the Xanth novels, an in-game ‘Com-Pendium of Xanth’ is provided to the player for the majority of the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/xanth/xanth_001.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The whole premise of this game is that you’ve been sucked into this fantasy world through your computer to act as an avatar for a force of good (or evil?) to undergo a quest to find some legendary artifact. Your opponent, who is the avatar for the other force of good (or evil?) is another person from Earth that has been recruited in the same fashion as you.</p>

<p>As you begin to explore the house on Earth where the game starts you’re presented with a pretty standard adventure game interface. The left hand side of the screen contains the fixed verb list, below that is navigation and options, to the right is your “party” view followed by descriptive text and your inventory.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/xanth/xanth_017.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After figuring out how to initially navigate, answering the phone, accepting the bet, getting the package and putting the disk in your computer you’ll be whisked off to the world of Xanth. This is a fantasy setting that apparently you (the player) don’t believe in. As a result you’re seen by the residents of the world as a floating computer screen.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/xanth/xanth_005.png" alt="" />
<em>The animation speeds are painfully slow during these sequences</em></p>

<p>Aside from the static view of the world you see most of the time, on occasion you’ll be greeted with a cut scene. This appears to be digitized photos animated at a rate of like 1 frame per minute, as the “action” during these exchanges just crawls. I tried cranking up the CPU cycles in DOSBox-X a few times to see if it helped, but it really wasn’t any better.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/xanth/xanth_006.png" alt="" />
<em>Nada the Naga Princess joins you on your quest to save Xanth</em></p>

<p>You’re not alone on this adventure, as you are joined by a companion from Xanth. I can’t remember if you could actually choose or if you were forced down a fixed selection path but I went with Nada Naga. Her icon will be present in the “party” view whenever she’s with you, and on every screen you can ask her questions, or ask for tips. She’s actually quite useful and helping to direct you to your next goal, and occasionally is a required piece of a multi-pronged puzzle you’ll have to solve.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/xanth/xanth_010.png" alt="" />
<em>The boat is a censor-ship … get it … GET IT??????</em></p>

<p>The puzzles is where this game kind of falls apart - especially if you’re not a native English speaker. EVERYTHING in this game is a pun, and on more than one occasion the solution requires you to not only know that it’s a pun, or double-entendre - but how to turn that phrase into meaning something literal.</p>

<p>I can’t imagine this was fun for kids playing in the early 90’s. I would have been 13 when this came out and the solutions to these puzzles would have just frustrated me to no end. Getting past the “Fireman and Hot Dog” for example requires you to ask Nada if she’s feeling hot, and when she says she is to ask her to put her hair in a bun. Then you take that bun, and put mustard on it. The fireman’s “hot dog” is afraid of the bun with mustard on it so he disappears.</p>

<p>To get the fireman to move along you need to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WAIT</code> for a minute, and he’ll give you fire water (because I guess he’s an alcoholic). Would a younger player know that this is alcohol - which then is needed in solving a fetch quest/item combo puzzle? Probably not …</p>

<p><img src="/images/adventure/xanth/xanth_022.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Waiting is also a recurring solution to puzzles. There is a dedicated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WAIT</code> command that will occasionally cause some condition on the current screen to change. Sometimes this is to get a different dialogue option, sometimes it’s to allow something to happen. For example the shimmering door in the desert will <em>eventually</em> appear if you alternate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WAIT</code>ing and asking Nada questions. I think she alludes to you having to be patient or something - I honestly don’t remember.</p>

<p>The main screen area can contain a larger text area when more information needs to be communicated, which is nicer than having to continually scroll the 2 lines the info bar typically presents you with.</p>

<p>There are a dozen or so NPCs that you will interact with throughout the game, and this is done via a standard dialogue tree. These interactions do advance the plot, but typically not before setting up some random fetch quest that involves a tedious amount of backtracking.</p>

<p>Though most areas are pretty short, some areas like the Burrow are enormous and maze-like. Thankfully the game gives you a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MAP</code> view that makes navigating these sections of the game a lot easier as they contain landmarks on each tile to help you remember what was where.</p>

<em>You’ll be really happy there’s a map once you reach the Burrow</em></p>

<p>From a gameplay perspective there is some generic looping ambient music, but it just fades into the background along with any sound effects so playing this game on mute would not detract from the overall experience. The artwork is pretty good on the static screens, but the cut scenes are so janky that you might forget about the parts of the game you were just enjoying visually.</p>

<em>Oh right, you get points too</em></p>

<p>Companions of Xanth is not breaking any new ground in the adventure game genre. The writing is not particularly good, but this may just be the adaptation of Piers Anthony’s work focusing too heavily on the puns and wordplay and less on character development and world building. I did leave this experience wanting to know a bit more about the world of Xanth, but not the game world - the books. I have a feeling these worlds are better experienced in writing than in game form, but that’s just my 2 cents.</p>
