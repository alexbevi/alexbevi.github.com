This N + 1 problem can manifest in any ODM or ORM,... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Visualizing a Replica Set's Sync Source Chain</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/03/23/visualizing-a-replica-sets-sync-source-chain/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Visualizing a Replica Set's Sync Source Chain" /><published>2021-03-23T10:47:41-04:00</published> <updated>2021-03-28T13:22:31-04:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/03/23/visualizing-a-replica-sets-sync-source-chain/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/03/23/visualizing-a-replica-sets-sync-source-chain/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="MongoDB" /> <summary> A MongoDB replica set is a group of mongod processes that maintain the same data set.

Secondaries capture data from the primary member to maintain an up to date copy of the sets’ dat... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>MongoDB 5.0 Initial Sync Progress Monitoring Improvements</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2020/11/20/mongodb-5-dot-0-startup2-progress-monitoring-improvements/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="MongoDB 5.0 Initial Sync Progress Monitoring Improvements" /><published>2020-11-20T10:31:26-05:00</published> <updated>2021-03-28T13:22:31-04:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2020/11/20/mongodb-5-dot-0-startup2-progress-monitoring-improvements/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2020/11/20/mongodb-5-dot-0-startup2-progress-monitoring-improvements/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="MongoDB" /> <summary> &amp;lt;SHAMELESS_PLUG&amp;gt; My previous article about initial sync progress monitoring got some attention, and as I’m a Technical Services Engineer at MongoDB, I got to provide direct feedback during the design phase of SERVER-47863: Initial Sync Progress Metrics!.
