When I recently moved into a Product Management role at MongoDB I brought a significant amount of technical expertise about MongoDB’s products with me, however I’ve been unsure as to how much of an advan... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Bug Hunting with the MongoDB Haskell Community</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/09/21/bug-hunting-with-the-mongodb-haskell-community/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bug Hunting with the MongoDB Haskell Community" /><published>2022-09-21T06:21:02-04:00</published> <updated>2022-10-06T03:13:06-04:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/09/21/bug-hunting-with-the-mongodb-haskell-community/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/09/21/bug-hunting-with-the-mongodb-haskell-community/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="MongoDB" /> <summary> MongoDB currently maintains 10 programming language Drivers in-house, including a Ruby driver for which I’m presently the Product Manager. Additionally we also have a library of community maintained drivers, built using the MongoDB Driver specifications our engineers maintain and publish. It was brought to my attention that one of these community drivers - the Haskell driver - was experiencing... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Solving a mongorestore failure due to 'Values in v:2 index key pattern cannot be of type object.'</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/09/15/createindex-error-values-in-v-2-index-key-pattern-cannot-be-of-type-object/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Solving a mongorestore failure due to 'Values in v:2 index key pattern cannot be of type object.'" /><published>2022-09-15T06:47:26-04:00</published> <updated>2022-09-16T10:05:45-04:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/09/15/createindex-error-values-in-v-2-index-key-pattern-cannot-be-of-type-object/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/09/15/createindex-error-values-in-v-2-index-key-pattern-cannot-be-of-type-object/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="MongoDB" /> <summary> Starting with MongoDB 4.4, the MongoDB Database Tools are now released separately from the MongoDB Server and use their own versioning, with an initial version of 100.0.0. Previously, these tools were released alongside the MongoDB Server and used matching versioning. If you use mongodump to backup your data using these newer versions, if you try to use an older (pre-4.4) version of mongoresto... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Performance Profiling a Mongoid Issue Using AppProfiler</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/09/09/performance-profiling-a-mongoid-issue-using-appprofiler/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Performance Profiling a Mongoid Issue Using AppProfiler" /><published>2022-09-09T06:41:01-04:00</published> <updated>2022-09-15T07:14:18-04:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/09/09/performance-profiling-a-mongoid-issue-using-appprofiler/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2022/09/09/performance-profiling-a-mongoid-issue-using-appprofiler/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="Ruby" /> <summary> In MONGOID-4889 the claim was made that assignment of a large number of embedded documents to an instance of a model will take increasingly longer as the size of the list of documents to embed grows. This is notable as no database operations are being performed during this process, which points to potential issues with the library itself.

At that time I’d make ad-hoc changes to my development database, export my table/function/stored procedure/view definitions to text files and check them into source control with any code changes. Using diff functionality I’d compare the schema changes that the DBAs needed to apply to production and we’d script that out separately... </summary> </entry> </feed>
