As with most of my ScummVM-related development, this fell by the wayside for a number of years, but recently I’ve rekindled my love of scripting (and Ruby) so I wanted to try and get this script at least into a (somewh... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Formatting MongoDB 4.4+ Logs</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/05/26/formatting-mongodb-4-dot-4-plus-logs/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Formatting MongoDB 4.4+ Logs" /><published>2021-05-26T08:21:00-04:00</published> <updated>2021-05-31T07:17:36-04:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/05/26/formatting-mongodb-4-dot-4-plus-logs/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/05/26/formatting-mongodb-4-dot-4-plus-logs/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="MongoDB" /> <summary> MongoDB has always output log entries as plaintext. Starting in MongoDB 4.4, mongod / mongos instances now output all log messages in structured JSON format. This includes log output sent to the file, syslog, and stdout (standard out) log destinations, as well as the output of the getLog command. The documentation includes Log Parsing Examples using the jq command line utility, but what i... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Sanitarium: The ScummVM Asylum Engine Journey Concludes</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/05/19/scummvm-asylum-engine/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sanitarium: The ScummVM Asylum Engine Journey Concludes" /><published>2021-05-19T06:32:45-04:00</published> <updated>2021-05-21T07:13:18-04:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/05/19/scummvm-asylum-engine/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/05/19/scummvm-asylum-engine/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="ScummVM" /> <summary> With PR#2982 - ENGINES: Sanitarium engine being recently merged into ScummVM I wanted to take some time to chronicle the original development efforts which began in 2009. At the time I was looking to work on a new engine in an attempt to improve my knowledge of C++ as well as to “give something back” to the open source community. Some of the engines I was toying with at the time included one’s... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Ruby Call Path Analysis using TracePoint</title><link href="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/05/07/call-path-analysis-using-tracepoint/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ruby Call Path Analysis using TracePoint" /><published>2021-05-07T09:56:11-04:00</published> <updated>2021-05-10T06:19:03-04:00</updated> <id>https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/05/07/call-path-analysis-using-tracepoint/</id> <content src="https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/05/07/call-path-analysis-using-tracepoint/" /> <author> <name>Alex Bevilacqua</name> </author> <category term="Programming" /> <summary> During a recent diagnostic analysis exercise I needed to identify if there was additional “work” being done based on a single option being changed. As Ruby offers numerous productivity tools for developers it should come as no surprise that a mechanism to easily produce a full call stack for one to many operations exists.

Octopress is a set of scripts and helpers built on top of Jekyll and provided a lot of convenience in the form of deployment helpers, themes and scripts.
