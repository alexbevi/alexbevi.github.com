        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>What is MongoDB FTDC (aka. <code>diagnostic.data</code>)</h1>

<p><a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/analyzing-mongodb-performance/#full-time-diagnostic-data-capture">Full Time Diagnostic Data Capture (FTDC)</a> was introduced in MongoDB 3.2 (via <a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-19585">SERVER-19585</a>), to incrementally collect the results of certain diagnostic commands to assist MongoDB support with troubleshooting issues.</p>

<p>On log rotation or startup, a <code>mongod</code> or <code>mongos</code> will collect and log:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/getCmdLineOpts/"><code>getCmdLineOpts</code></a>: <code>db.adminCommand({getCmdLineOpts: true})</code></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/buildInfo/"><code>buildInfo</code></a>: <code>db.adminCommand({buildInfo: true})</code></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/hostInfo/"><code>hostInfo</code></a>: <code>db.adminCommand({hostInfo: true})</code></li>
</ul>


<p>As configured by <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/parameters/index.html#param.diagnosticDataCollectionPeriodMillis"><code>diagnosticDataCollectionPeriodMillis</code></a> and defaulting to every 1 second, FTDC will collect to output of the following commands:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/serverStatus/"><code>serverStatus</code></a>: <code>db.serverStatus({tcmalloc: true})</code></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/replSetGetStatus/"><code>replSetGetStatus</code></a>: <code>rs.status()</code></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/collStats/"><code>collStats</code></a> for the <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/local-database/#local.oplog.rs"><code>local.oplog.rs</code></a> collection (<a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod">mongod</a> only)</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/connPoolStats/#dbcmd.connPoolStats"><code>connPoolStats</code></a> (<a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#bin.mongos">mongos</a> only)</li>
</ul>


<p>When FTDC is enabled (per <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/parameters/index.html#param.diagnosticDataCollectionEnabled"><code>diagnosticDataCollectionEnabled</code></a>), the <code>metrics.xxxxxxx</code> files will be stored in <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/parameters/index.html#param.diagnosticDataCollectionDirectoryPath"><code>diagnosticDataCollectionDirectoryPath</code></a> which by default is the <em>diagnostic.data</em> directory within the <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#systemLog.path"><code>systemLog.path</code></a>.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-21818">SERVER-21818</a> (introduced in MongoDB 3.2.13) and <a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-31400">SERVER-31400</a> (introduced in MongoDB 3.4.16) the diagnostic data capture scope was broadened to not only include internal diagnostic commands but system metrics as well. Depending on the host operating system, the diagnostic data may include one or more of the following statistics:</p>

<ul>
<li>CPU utilization (ex: <a href="http://www.linuxhowtos.org/System/procstat.htm"><code>/proc/stat</code></a>)</li>
<li>Memory utilization (ex: <a href="https://www.thegeekdiary.com/understanding-proc-meminfo-file-analyzing-memory-utilization-in-linux/"><code>/proc/meminfo</code></a>)</li>
<li>Disk utilization related to performance (ex: <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/block/stat.txt"><code>*/sys/block/\*/stat*</code></a>)</li>
<li>Network performance statistics (<a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/435579/is-there-documentation-for-proc-net-netstat-and-proc-net-snmp"><code>/proc/net/netstat</code></a>)</li>
</ul>


<p>The <code>metrics.xxxxxxx</code> files in the <code>diagnostic.data</code> directory contain only statistics about the performance of the system and the database. They are stored in a compressed format, and are not human-readable.</p>

<p>Just a quick note regarding privacy, regardless of the version, the data in <em>diagnostic.data</em> never contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>Samples of queries, query predicates, or query results</li>
<li>Data sampled from any end-user collection or index</li>
<li>System or MongoDB user credentials or security certificates</li>
</ul>


<p>FTDC data contains certain host machine information such as hostnames, operating system information, and the options or settings used to start the <code>mongod</code> or <code>mongos</code>. This information may be considered protected or confidential by some organizations or regulatory bodies, but is not typically considered to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data">Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to have a closer look at the diagnostic data collection process, you can inspect the <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/tree/master/src/mongo/db/ftdc">FTDC code</a>.</p>

<h2>FTDC Structure</h2>

<!-- MORE -->


<p>There are two types of FTDC documents: a <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/r4.2.3/src/mongo/db/ftdc/util.h#L136">BSON metadata document</a>, or a <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/r4.2.3/src/mongo/db/ftdc/util.h#L150">BSON metric chunk</a>.</p>

<p>Each document is made up of an <code>_id</code>, a <code>type</code> and either a <code>doc</code> or <code>data</code> field. The <code>type</code> field is used to identify the document type:</p>

<ul>
<li>0: Metadata Document</li>
<li>1: Metric Chunk</li>
</ul>


<p>The <code>doc</code> or <code>data</code> fields will contain &ldquo;samples&rdquo; in the form of:</p>

<p>During each collection interval (as configured by <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/parameters/index.html#param.diagnosticDataCollectionPeriodMillis"><code>diagnosticDataCollectionPeriodMillis</code></a>), a metric chunk will be created and a sample will be collected, compressed and stored to the <code>data</code> document as Binary Data.</p>

<p>This sample can contain the results of internal commands such as <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/serverStatus/"><code>serverStatus</code></a>,<a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/replSetGetStatus/"><code>replSetGetStatus</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/collStats/"><code>collStats</code></a> for the <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/local-database/#local.oplog.rs"><code>local.oplog.rs</code></a> collection or <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/connPoolStats/#dbcmd.connPoolStats"><code>connPoolStats</code></a>, as well as external system metrics.</p>

<h2>Working with FTDC</h2>

<p>FTDC files, such as the <code>metrics.2019-10-28T19-02-23Z-00000</code> sample we&rsquo;ll be working with below are just <a href="http://bsonspec.org/">BSON</a> files. As such, the <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/bsondump/"><code>bsondump</code></a> utility can be used to inspect the contents:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">METRICS</span><span class="o">=</span>metrics.2019-10-28T19-02-23Z-00000
</span><span class='line'>bsondump --quiet <span class="nv">$METRICS</span> <span class="p">|</span> less
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/ftdc-001.png"></p>

<p><code>bsondump</code> will default to emitting JSON, so we can interact with this using the <a href=""><code>jq</code></a> utility. For example, if we only want to review the <em>Metadata Document</em> this could be done as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c"># bsondump &lt; 4.0</span>
</span><span class='line'>bsondump --quiet <span class="nv">$METRICS</span> <span class="p">|</span> jq -s <span class="s1">&#39;.[] | select( .type == 0)&#39;</span> <span class="p">|</span> less
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># bsondump &gt;= 4.0</span>
</span><span class='line'>bsondump --quiet <span class="nv">$METRICS</span> <span class="p">|</span> jq -s <span class="s1">&#39;.[] | select( .type | .&quot;$numberInt&quot; == &quot;0&quot;)&#39;</span> <span class="p">|</span> less
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/ftdc-002.png"></p>

<p>Working with <em>Metric Chunks</em> is a little more complicated as they are actually zlib compressed BSON documents.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>  bsondump --quiet
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You eagle-eyed Rubyists will notice that we&rsquo;re clipping the first 4 bytes from the binary data we&rsquo;re reading from STDIN. This is to drop the header before we try to decompress the stream.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t do this <a href="https://www.zlib.net/">zlib</a> will complain and fail:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>Traceback <span class="o">(</span>most recent call last<span class="o">)</span>:
</span><span class='line'>        1: from -e:1:in <span class="sb">`</span>&lt;main&gt;<span class="s1">&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s1">-e:1:in `inflate&#39;</span>: incorrect header check <span class="o">(</span>Zlib::DataError<span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The binary data has now been decompressed, and being BSON data we run it through <code>bsondump</code> again and voila:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/ftdc-003.png"></p>

<p>Hopefully this helps shed some light on what FTDC data is and what it contains. In a future post we&rsquo;ll look into doing something useful with this treasure trove of telemetry our clusters are generating every 1 second or so.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently found myself troubleshooting another <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> startup issue due to potential corruption within a <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/wiredtiger/">WiredTiger</a> file. As I have previously covered this topic (see <a href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2016/02/10/recovering-a-wiredtiger-collection-from-a-corrupt-mongodb-installation/">&ldquo;Recovering a WiredTiger collection from a corrupt MongoDB installation&rdquo;</a>), I wanted to share the diagnostic and troubleshooting journey in case it helps anyone who experiences this issue in the future.</p>

<p>To ensure I could troubleshoot this issue in isolation, I first collected a backup of the necessary files from the affected installation as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once I had this backup I extracted it to a new location, then using <a href="https://github.com/aheckmann/m">m</a> to select the versions of MongoDB to use tried to startup a standalone instance to see if I could reproduce the issue:</p>

<p>The <code>mongod</code> is failing to startup successfully due to an invariant failure during <code>KVCatalog::init</code>. We are able to determine this as the <code>mongod</code> log above tells us:</p>

<ol>
<li>The MongoDB version in used (3.4.18)</li>
<li>The path to the source file where the failure occurred (file: <code>src/mongo/db/storage/kv/kv_catalog.cpp</code>, line: 305)</li>
</ol>


<p>As MongoDB is open source, we can view the source for this release by going to <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/r3.4.18/src/mongo/db/storage/kv/kv_catalog.cpp#L305,">https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/r3.4.18/src/mongo/db/storage/kv/kv_catalog.cpp#L305,</a> which will show us the following:</p>

<p>The comment preceding the invariant<sup id="f1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> indicates that there&rsquo;s only one feature document to be present in the catalog, but what&rsquo;s the catalog?</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As there&rsquo;s only one file that contains the word &ldquo;catalog&rdquo; this is good a place as any to start. The <code>_mdb_catalog</code> is a WiredTiger file, so to interact with it directly (outside of MongoDB) we will need to use the <a href="http://source.wiredtiger.com/mongodb-3.4/command_line.html">WiredTiger command line utility</a>, also know as <code>wt</code>.</p>

<p>The documentation link for <code>mongodb-3.4</code> points us to WiredTiger 2.9.2, so following the <a href="http://source.wiredtiger.com/mongodb-3.4/build-posix.html">build and installation instructions</a> we compile a <code>wt</code> binary with support for the snappy compressor. This is due to MongoDB&rsquo;s WiredTiger storage engine using snappy as the default block compressor (see <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/wiredtiger/#compression">&ldquo;Compression&rdquo;</a>).</p>

<p>INTERESTING! I&rsquo;m not really sure how the catalog was able to get into a state where two feature documents exist, but since we have a dump of the catalog let&rsquo;s try to remove one of those entries and then load the dump back into the catalog.</p>

<p>As the results appear to be identical, we&rsquo;ll just drop the first one and then try to load it back into the catalog.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If the table loaded successfully the output of the command should be something like <code>table:_mdb_catalog: 822</code>.</p>

<p>With a reloaded catalog, let&rsquo;s try spinning up the <code>mongod</code> again:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>SUCCESS! The <code>mongod</code> is still crashing as the backing files for the database don&rsquo;t exist, but we should now be able to take our recovered files back to our node that was previously failing.</p>

<p>From our recovered directory compress the following files:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>tar -czvf recovered.tar.gz --exclude<span class="o">=</span>WiredTigerStat* WiredTiger* _mdb_catalog.wt sizeStorer.wt
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that if the <code>mongod</code> fails to start with the recovered files you may have to clear out the <code>journal/</code> directory.</p>

<p>Hopefully this helps someone someday ;)</p>

<p>Given the 3 documents we&rsquo;ve setup above, if I wanted to filter a pipeline to only <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/match"><code>$match</code></a>

<p>Now if your pipeline is running in a non-Javascript environment, the <code>new Date()</code> call within the pipeline
would likely throw an exception.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re working with MongoDB 4.2 or newer though, a new <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/aggregation-variables/#variable.NOW"><code>$$NOW</code> aggregation variable</a> is available that can be combined with existing pipeline operators to <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/subtract/index.html"><code>$subtract</code></a> the number of milliseconds in the number of days to filter from the current date:</p>

        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2018/10/01/technical-services-engineering-at-mongodb</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The goal of this post is to provide a first hand account of what it means to be a <em>Technical Services Engineer</em> at <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/careers/jobs/791258">MongoDB</a>, as well as what the journey getting to this point has looked like for me.</p>

<h3>WHO AM I?</h3>

<p>I have been working in Application Development and Software Engineering for nearly two decades. I started off writing desktop applications in QuickBASIC and Turbo Pascal, then eventually in VB6, VB.NET, C++ and C#. When it was time to shift focus to web development I started off with HTML/JS/CSS (as we all do :P), then in Flash/AS3, Flex, Python, Ruby/Rails and Node.js.</p>

<p>I have been writing software since I was a kid, starting with some automation tools for my mom&rsquo;s business. I then moved on to building tools to help me cheat at various games I was playing at the time, and eventually got more into emulator programming and reverse engineering. I guess you could say I&rsquo;ve always loved solving problems programmatically, and especially enjoyed identifying opportunities for automation and custom tooling.</p>

<p>This led me down an informal DevOps track, as I was finding there was a need for optimization in the infrastructure layers that my applications were deployed to. This led me deeper into Linux internals, system administration and network operations.</p>

<p>While I was gaining these new skill-sets my primary focus was always on application development and delivery. Before coming to MongoDB I was working as a Development Lead / System Architect, but I found that my focus was always being drawn back to solving performance challenges at the infrastructure level.</p>

<!-- MORE -->


<h3>WHY MONGODB?</h3>

<p>I started working with MongoDB on a number of &ldquo;hobby&rdquo; projects around 2012. At the time I really only had experience with RDBMS', but due to the unstructured nature of the data I was working with decided to give this new technology a whirl.</p>

<p>I fell in love with the database almost immediately, and have since carried it forward to multiple new employers, as well as contract opportunities and consulting engagements.</p>

<p>The low barrier to entry from a development bootstrapping perspective made it the ideal backend for proof-of-concept development through to production deployment.</p>

<p>As a result of this increased activity with MongoDB, I found my self doing a lot more investigation into <a href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2018/05/28/troubleshooting-a-mongodb-performance-issue/">performance issues</a> and <a href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2016/02/10/recovering-a-wiredtiger-collection-from-a-corrupt-mongodb-installation/">internals</a> (links are to blog posts of challenges I encountered and resolved).</p>

<h3>WHY TECHNICAL SERVICES?</h3>

<p>This was initially very challenging for me, as I had pre-conceived notions as to what &ldquo;technical services&rdquo; actually implied. The first thoughts that popped in my head were &ldquo;technical support&rdquo;, &ldquo;client support&rdquo;, &ldquo;call center style support&rdquo;, etc.</p>

<p>While researching this position I came across a blog post from about six years ago by a MongoDB employee who blogged about his experience as a Support Engineer (in this <a href="http://blog.markofu.com/2012/07/being-support-engineer-10gen-part-1.html">two</a> <a href="http://blog.markofu.com/2012/10/being-support-engineer-10gen-part-2.html">part</a> series).</p>

<p>I found his reasons for joining MongoDB (10gen at the time), description of what kinds of challenges the job poses on a daily basis and how there is a constant push for self improvement and continuing education to align with what I was looking for in a new opportunity.</p>

<h3>WHAT&rsquo;S A TECHNICAL SERVICES ENGINEER ON PAPER</h3>

<p>To answer this question, let&rsquo;s start off by analyzing the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/careers/jobs/791258">job posting</a> that kicked off this journey for me in the first place.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/why_tse/why_tse_001.png"></p>

<p>So they&rsquo;re looking for people that are able to solve problems and communicate clearly. This could be a call center gig after all &hellip; oh wait, <em>experts in MongoDB related database servers, drivers, tools, services</em> &hellip; hrm, maybe there&rsquo;s a bit more to this.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/why_tse/why_tse_002.png"></p>

<p><em>Architecture, performance, recovery, security</em>, those are a lot more complex than what you would face in a traditional support role. What really sold me though was the <em>contribute to internal projects</em> statement, as this aligned perfectly with my desire for process improvement through custom tooling.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/why_tse/why_tse_003.png"></p>

<p>By the time I got to this point in the job posting I was already sold. MongoDB is either trying to staff their first tier support with ridiculously over-qualified employees, or Technical Services really isn&rsquo;t what I would have thought.</p>

<p>I proceeded to fill out the application, attach my resume and cover letter and crossed my fingers.</p>

<h3>WHAT&rsquo;S A TECHNICAL SERVICES ENGINEER IN PRACTICE</h3>

<p>After working with other TSEs for the past two months and having had an opportunity to handle some of my own cases I think I can shed a bit of light on what this role really entails.</p>

<h4>HOW IS IT A SUPPORT ROLE?</h4>

<p>A Technical Services Engineer interacts with MongoDB&rsquo;s clients via a support queue. This allows incoming &ldquo;cases&rdquo; to be prioritized and categorized to allow engineers to quickly identify what form of subject matter expertise may be required (ex: <code>Indexing</code>, <code>Replication</code>, <code>Sharding</code>, <code>Performance</code>, <code>Networking</code>, etc).</p>

<p>As a TSE you&rsquo;re responsible for claiming cases from a queue and providing feedback in a timely fashion that is clear, concise and technically accurate.</p>

<h4>HOW IS IT AN ENGINEERING ROLE?</h4>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the juicy part of this job. Although replying to client requests is the &ldquo;deliverable&rdquo; for a TSE, how you go about reproducing their issues requires a very deep understanding of MongoDB internals, software engineering, network engineering, infrastructure architecture and technical troubleshooting.</p>

<p>Depending on the type of issue, a reproduction is likely in store. These involve recreating the environment (locally or in the cloud) to either benchmark or replicate the identified client challenge. There is a vast library of tools available to TSEs for these types of tasks, but on some occasions the right tool for the job may not exist.</p>

<p>In these cases, you have an opportunity to write your own scripts or tools to parse logs, measure performance, record telemetry or verify a hypothesis. Although MongoDB doesn&rsquo;t require TSEs to have any programming experience, for those like me that come from product engineering it&rsquo;s refreshing to know there&rsquo;s still an opportunity to scratch the development itch.</p>

<p>With each case you learn more about the inner working of the database, the tools, the drivers and OS level performance.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION?</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m leaving the closing section here as a question, as the TSE role continues to be redefined and refined as new MongoDB products come on board and new challenges present themselves.</p>

<p>What will likely remain constant though is the need for new engineers to have the following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<li>a passion for continuing technical education</li>
<li>a willingness to step outside their comfort zone</li>
<li>an interest in software engineering</li>
<li>an interest in network operations</li>
</ul>


<p>I encourage you to check out MongoDB&rsquo;s <a href="https://grnh.se/dcd90aac1">available jobs</a> if what I&rsquo;ve described here interests you (I swear HR is not putting me up to this &hellip;) as we could use more engineers like you in our ranks :)</p>

        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2018/08/14/hello-mongodb</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As of August 13th, I am no longer a System Architect at DAC Group. I have a public post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6432589236368601088/">LinkedIn</a> that got some good traction, but to summarize it was time to move on.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a software engineer in some capacity or another for nearly 20 years now. The position I&rsquo;ve taken is as a <em>Technical Services Engineer</em>, which is more of a support role than an active development role.</p>

<p>The decision to make this move wasn&rsquo;t make lightly. I&rsquo;ve been working hands on with code or overseeing a team of developers on a day to day basis for most of my professional career. As such, I was also involved with software engineering, and this was no different in my role as a <em>System Architect</em>.</p>

<p>In that role, I was still committing code on a nearly daily basis. If not, I was performing code review, or working on a design for a new system or solution. I would consider this all to still be &ldquo;hands on&rdquo;, though I had found myself mired in DevOps work a lot more than I would have liked (there were not sufficient Linux Sysadmins available to assist with the type of server operations oversight that was required).</p>

<p>The role at MongoDB isn&rsquo;t a traditional &ldquo;Tech Support&rdquo; type of role, as it requires a strong knowledge of networking, databases, system design, programming and client services. I&rsquo;ve been a fan of the MongoDB server for over 8 years now, and have brought it along with me to several new consulting opportunities as well as the full time jobs I&rsquo;ve help. I believe very strongly in the quality of this product, as well as the peripheral products that they&rsquo;ve developed.</p>

<p>I think the time has come for a new adventure. This is the first step towards a new career journey with a new company, as opposed to an incremental move upwards within the same professional space.</p>

        <link href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2018/05/28/troubleshooting-a-mongodb-performance-issue/"/>
        <updated>2018-05-28T09:14:03-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2018/05/28/troubleshooting-a-mongodb-performance-issue</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>UPDATE (2018-06-28):</strong> <em>I actually sent a link to this article to the author of the previous blog post and in her reply she indicates that the improvements to cache management and checkpoint areas were more likely to have improved my situation. Just wanted to call out how approachable the MongoDB team is even with these one-off type issues :). Thanks Sue!</em></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE (2018-06-21):</strong> <em>As we were running MongoDB 3.0.15 while all these issues were going on it&rsquo;s entirely possible that the <a href="https://engineering.mongodb.com/post/breaking-the-wiredtiger-logjam-the-write-ahead-log-1-2">optimizations made to the write-ahead log of WiredTiger</a> may have also contributed to this improvement in performance :)</em></p>

<p>The following is an edited excerpt from an email I sent out internally about an intermittent performance issue we&rsquo;ve been experiencing for several years now. The daily processing challenges we&rsquo;ve been experiencing revolved around running server-side javascript in order to produce daily reports. As our data ingestion rates rose and our data processing needs climbed, our server performance continued to degrade. This would occur regardless of the size of the VMs we would spin up.</p>

<h3>Postmortem</h3>

<p>Our MongoDB cluster is configured with three (3) servers: 1x primary (write-enabled) and 2x secondaries (read-only). These are running on Azure DS14v2 VMs with 8TB of storage (8x 1TB striped via LVM as these were the largest premium SSD-based data disks available at the time).</p>

<p>Aside from the servers being scaled up periodically, this configuration has been constant since the inception of the product.</p>

<p>The only major upgrade came in the form of a migration from 2.6 to 3.0 in 2015. At the time this was a major shift as it required rewriting a number of the underlying system scripts as well as introducing LRS-based storage to try and squeeze some additional performance out of the disks. Why optimize for IOPS? Because the reporting platform was designed to copy a lot of data back and forth in order to generate reports segmented by dimension (&ldquo;Group&rdquo;, &ldquo;Company&rdquo;, &ldquo;Country&rdquo;, &ldquo;State&rdquo;, &ldquo;City&rdquo;).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/20180528-mongo-001.png"></p>

<p>This chart (48 hours sampled from 1 week ago) shows <em>Cache Usage</em> spiking and <em>Replication Lag</em> spiking. The cache spikes occur as new writes trigger index activity, which invalidates (dirties) cached memory and causes cache eviction.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>This slows down the speed at which the secondaries can request data from the primary, which spikes the lag. When the secondaries request more data, it would lock up the primary, which in turn affected the primary server’s ability to ingest new content and write it to disk. The read/write buffers back up and new write requests are throttled.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> &mdash; As of MongoDB 4.0, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-40-release-candidate-0-has-landed">non-blocking secondary reads</a> have been added to address these types of latency issues.</p>

<p>This type of cascading failure was almost exclusively seen when a large batch process was being run in the morning directly on the primary mongod instance in the mornings..</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/20180528-mongo-002.png"></p>

<p>This chart (48 hours sampled from 2 weeks ago) shows similar behaviour. The vertical lines show points at which we were forced to restart instances or cycle the primary server in order to recover resources.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that cache usage hits a certain point on the primary (left) server after which we have to kill the instance. The replication lag on the secondaries is also inconsistent, which would lead us to believe that the consumption rates from the primary are being affected by either network performance or disk performance.</p>

<p>In the absence of dedicated DevOps, DBAs or Infrastructure Engineers, the development teams have spent a significant amount of time learning to tune and troubleshoot this installation. Due to lack of specialization though occasionally issues may be misdiagnosed.</p>

<p>We completed a significant upgrade on Tuesday that brings our cluster up to mongodb-server 3.4.15 (from 3.0.15). The 3.0 series was first introduced in March 2015, with an end of life of February 2018. As no further security updates are being released, we’ve been coordinating tests with the product development teams for the past 12 months in order to prepare for a major upgrade.</p>

<p>This involved the deprecation of client-side javascript calls, as well as rewriting several map/reduce operations as aggregation pipelines to ensure when the transition happened there was no sudden outage.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve been running 3.4 in production for a few days I checked the same 48 hour sample and found something interesting …</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/20180528-mongo-003.png"></p>

<p>The cache usage has remained steady since we turned the instances on. The replication lag also hasn’t gone much higher than a minute in the past few days (this could creep up to over an hour in the past!).</p>

<p>These samples include report generation for all products as well, so they represent the same load. We’ll have to continue to monitor this, but the initial results seem to show that a lot of the pain we’ve been suffering through may have stemmed from outdated software.</p>

<p>The way the review report is generated is still extremely inefficient, but if we continue seeing results like this for the foreseeable future then the urgency of redesigning that product drops and can be properly managed.</p>

<p>Here are some lessons we learned as a result of this investigation:</p>

<p><strong>Measure Everything</strong> &mdash; Without proper telemetry in place, not only is it difficult to identify negative trends, but it’s almost impossible to showcase the success of any change or action.</p>

<p><strong>Understand Your Tech</strong>  &mdash; Whether you’re using hosted, provisioned, on-premise, containerized, PAAS or some other solution as part of the application architecture, make sure you really understand how to use it, and how to support it. When MongoDB was introduced to the project it was done so to fill a specific need. Once that need was filled, resourcing discussions surrounding maintainability and support should likely have been prioritized.</p>

<p><strong>Document Everything</strong>  &mdash; As discoveries are made, write them down and share them. Knowledge sharing is even more important when you’re dealing with issues that go beyond the standard requirements of &ldquo;application development&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Ask For Help</strong> &mdash; When it becomes necessary to step outside your comfort zone to solve a problem, a fresh perspective can be welcome.</p>

<p>Hopefully this journey benefits someone else in a similar situation.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t a super lucrative endeavour, but considering I published this book three years ago and it&rsquo;s still in demand, I can&rsquo;t complain.</p>

<p>If I had more time on my hands I might look into writing about something a bit more &ldquo;in demand&rdquo;, like <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> or <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/core">.NET Core</a> (random topics I&rsquo;m currently interested in :P).</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is possibly a solution to a problem no one other than me has, but once in a while I like to challenge myself to see if something ridiculous is possible.</p>

<p>This time around I wanted to see if I could take my old <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_x_(2nd_gen)-6649.php">Moto X (2014)</a> and use it as a <a href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex Media Server</a>.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to just see if I could install Plex though; I wanted to see if it would be possible to actually run a PMS instance along with <a href="https://sonarr.tv/">Sonarr</a> to download content automatically for shows I&rsquo;m interested in.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/moto-plex/moto-plex-003.png"></p>

<p>This introduced a couple of challenges, as Sonarr would need to be run using <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> (as it&rsquo;s a .NET project), I&rsquo;d need a Bittorrent client to actually download the content, and I&rsquo;d likely need to be running a <a href="https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett">Jackett</a> service to allow Sonarr to process request through sites like The Pirate Bay.</p>

<p>Finally, as the Moto X is an ARM device, all of our software will need to be capable of running on an ARM platform.</p>

<p>Note that this process (with some minor changes) can be used to get a Plex + Sonarr + Jackett + Filebot + Transmission setup done on any Linux distribution. I just thought it would be fun to do it using a phone.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Setup the Phone</h2>

<p>This was the easiest part, as it simply required rooting the device so we could install <a href="https://download.chainfire.eu/696/supersu/">SuperSU</a>.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/moto-plex/moto-plex-001.png"></p>

<p>With a factory reset instance and root access, the next step was to install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=stericson.busybox&amp;hl=en">BusyBox</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.meefik.linuxdeploy&amp;hl=en">Linux Deploy</a>.</p>

<p>Once both are installed from the Play Store, run Busy Box and select <em>Install</em>. You should only have to run this once, as it just installs a handful of Unix tools that Linux Deploy will need for the next step.</p>

<p>Linux Deploy will require a bit more configuration as you need to tweak it a bit to suit your needs.</p>

<p>First, select the repository you&rsquo;d like. For my phone I went with <strong>ubuntu-lxde_arm</strong>, as this would setup an Ubuntu 16.04 LXDE distro along with VNC and SSH. Those will come into play when we want to start setting up Sonarr and Plex.</p>

<p>Under the properties for the repository (the settings icon in the lower right next to the <em>Stop</em> button) I set the <em>Installation type</em> to <strong>Directory</strong>. This setting allows use to have access to all available storage on our device. The first time I tried this I used the default of <strong>File</strong>, which only gave me 2GB of storage to play with. Once the base installation was done, there wasn&rsquo;t enough space left for me to do much. I tried tweaking the <em>Image Size (MB)</em> setting and starting over but it didn&rsquo;t make a difference. Your milage may vary, so feel free to try other configurations.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/moto-plex/moto-plex-002.png"></p>

<p>Next, from the top-right menu you need to <em>Install</em> the selected repository. This will do the basic installation of the Linux distribution you selected and pre-configure it for SSH and VNC access.</p>

<p>Once installed, click on the <strong>Start</strong> button to boot up the image. After a lot of terminal scrolling, you&rsquo;ll see something along the lines of <code>&lt;&lt;&lt; start</code> on the last line and the text will stop. This is our signal to start setting up our software.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve now got Linux running alongside Android on our phone. Let&rsquo;s SSH into it and continue. The credentials are available under the repository properties. You can change these prior to installation or just use the defaults that are generated.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Plex</h2>

<p>There isn&rsquo;t an official ARM distribution of Plex, but thanks to some great work by <a href="https://github.com/uglymagoo/plexmediaserver-installer">Jan Friedrich</a>, we can easily patch the Plex NAS distribution for ARM or ARM64.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>sudo apt-get install -y fakeroot git
</span><span class='line'>git clone https://github.com/uglymagoo/plexmediaserver-installer
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">cd </span>plexmediaserver-installer
</span><span class='line'>mkdir ../plex-installer<span class="p">;</span> git archive master <span class="p">|</span> tar -x -C ../plex-installer/
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">cd</span> ..<span class="p">;</span> fakeroot dpkg-deb --build plex-installer ./
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will create a Debian package that can be installed directly. For me, it produced <code>plexmediaserver-installer_1.9.1.4272-b207937f1-2_armhf.deb</code>, so installation was done using:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>sudo dpkg -i plexmediaserver-installer_1.9.1.4272-b207937f1-2_armhf.deb
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then, to start up your Plex Media Server:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>start_pms
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can verify it by going to <a href="http://phone-ip:32400/web/index.html.">http://phone-ip:32400/web/index.html.</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to set anything up here yet as we first need our media source available, which we&rsquo;ll be doing next.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Sonarr and Jackett</h2>

<p>Sonarr can be installed from a repository list, so we&rsquo;ll just set that up on our phone. Sonarr will also require Mono to be installed, which luckily for us is also available from Ubuntu compiled for armhf.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>sudo apt-get install -y libmono-cil-dev mono-devel libcurl4-openssl-dev
</span><span class='line'>sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys FDA5DFFC
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>sudo <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;deb http://apt.sonarr.tv/ master main&quot;</span> <span class="p">|</span> sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sonarr.list
</span><span class='line'>sudo apt-get update
</span><span class='line'>sudo apt-get install -y nzbdrone
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><img class="center" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/moto-plex/moto-plex-004.png"></p>

<p>Before we configure Sonarr, we&rsquo;ll setup Jackett. Jackett can be used to connect a torrent search site as a <a href="https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr/wiki/Supported-Indexers#torznab">Torznab feed</a> to Sonarr.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this test I just setup The Pirate Bay, but Jackett supports a number of sites that may better suit your needs ;)</p>

<p>To start Jackett, we&rsquo;ll need to run it using Mono:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>mono --debug ~/Jackett/JackettConsole.exe
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Jackett will be available at <a href="http://phone-ip:9117.">http://phone-ip:9117.</a> Once you&rsquo;ve configured a search site in Jackett, you can start Sonarr and begin configuration.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>mono --debug ~/Jackett/JackettConsole.exe
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Sonarr will start up at <a href="http://phone-ip:8989.">http://phone-ip:8989.</a> First we&rsquo;ll setup an <em>Indexer</em> (from <em>Settings -> Indexers</em>). This is where we&rsquo;ll plug in the details we configured in Jackett. You&rsquo;ll need exact url from Jackett, as well as the API key. This information is all easy to find from the Jackett interface.</p>

<p>Next, setup a TV show from the <em>Series</em> section. Once added we&rsquo;ll need to configure way to download content automatically when Sonarr detects a new episode. This is done under <em>Settings -> Download Client</em>.</p>

<p>Create a new <a href="https://transmissionbt.com/">Transmission</a> client, give it a name and leave the default settings.</p>

<p>The only issue now though is that we don&rsquo;t have Transmission setup &hellip;</p>

<h2>Setting Up Transmission and Filebot</h2>

<p>Both of these are going to be a bit challenging, as <a href="https://www.filebot.net/">Filebot</a> (which we&rsquo;ll be using to move and organize our downloads) needs <a href="https://www.java.com/en/">Java</a>, and Transmission requires a display server (can&rsquo;t be run from SSH).</p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s install whatever we can from our existing SSH session:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>sudo <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu precise main&quot;</span> <span class="p">|</span> sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
</span><span class='line'>sudo <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu precise main&quot;</span> <span class="p">|</span> sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
</span><span class='line'>sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys EEA14886
</span><span class='line'>sudo apt-get update
</span><span class='line'>sudo apt-get install -y curl oracle-java8-installer transmission
</span><span class='line'>curl -L -O https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/filebot/filebot/FileBot_4.7.9/filebot_4.7.9_armhf.deb
</span><span class='line'>sudo dpkg -i  filebot_4.7.9_armhf.deb
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> if you get an error installing the key via <code>apt-key</code>, try the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys EEA14886
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In order to use Filebot, we&rsquo;ll need a script we can call from Transmission. The script I&rsquo;m working with is as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>
</span><span class='line'>filebot -non-strict -script fn:amc --output /home/android/Media --log-file /home/android/amc.log --action move --conflict auto --def <span class="nv">music</span><span class="o">=</span>n --def <span class="nv">subtitles</span><span class="o">=</span>n --def <span class="nv">artwork</span><span class="o">=</span>y --def <span class="nv">backdrops</span><span class="o">=</span>n --def <span class="nv">clean</span><span class="o">=</span>y <span class="s2">&quot;seriesFormat= /home/android/Media/TV/{n}/{fn}&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;ut_dir=$TR_TORRENT_DIR/$TR_TORRENT_NAME&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;ut_kind=multi&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;ut_title=$TR_TORRENT_NAME&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This script assumes that (a) your home directory is <code>/home/android</code>, and (b) you will be storing your media for Plex at <code>/home/android/Media/TV</code>. Feel free to modify the values to fit your particular installation.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s save this script as <strong>transmission-postprocess</strong> and make it executable using <code>chmod +x transmission-postprocess</code>.</p>

<p>Next, we&rsquo;ll need to actually VNC into our Linux distro. This is due to Transmission being a GTK application so we&rsquo;ll need to interact with it in a desktop environment.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/moto-plex/moto-plex-005.png"></p>

<p>From the desktop, launch Transmission and go to <em>Edit -> Preferences</em>. We want to do two things now:</p>

<ul>
<li>Setup Remote Access</li>
<li>Under <em>Downloading</em> setup the script we created above to be called when a torrent completes</li>
</ul>


<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/moto-plex/moto-plex-006.png">
<small>open in new tab to see full size</small></p>

<p>Going back to our Plex Media Server url, we can now setup a library that points to our downloaded media directory.</p>

<p>When Sonarr detects a new episode, it will send the torrent link it finds from our TPB indexer to Transmission, and on completion Filebot will analyze the file and move it to the appropriate series/season folder for the show that was downloaded.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>Although I&rsquo;m a huge fan of the point-and-click adventure genre, I&rsquo;ve been primarily focusing on covering 16-bit RPGs in my spare time. I&rsquo;ve still got a sizeable backlog to wade through, but when the news dropped that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_Adventures:_Lord_of_the_Clans">Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans</a> had been leaked, I couldn&rsquo;t resist.</p>

<p>Although no one really got a taste of this game until 2010 when MAN-biker posted some content to Youtube, I&rsquo;d been inquiring with Blizzard as early as 2008. I still have a copy of the email, so I&rsquo;ve trimmed it down a bit and shared it below.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t really a support question, and I have no idea how to route this
properly, but the question I want to ask is as follows:</p>

<p>Over the years, I&#39;m sure there have been numerous attempts by fans to get Blizzard
to revive the Warcraft Adventures project. The statement made when it was cancelled
was that it didn&#39;t meet the quality requirements that Blizzard was trying to keep
for it&#39;s users; and over the years, those decisions have resulted in excellent titles.</p>

<p>Regarding Warcraft Adventures though, it&#39;s been 10 years since this project was
cancelled. I don&#39;t have any inside information into the level of completion the
project was at, but if it was &#39;near&#39; completion, couldn&#39;t this be released to the
open-source community to be added to a project such as ScummVM? The benefit here
would be positive PR for Blizzard, as well as renewed interest in their catalog of
games to a number of new users.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t represent the ScummVM team, but I&#39;d be interested to know what you
guys think. -Alex</p>

<p>Greetings Alex,</p>

<p>Thank you for emailing the Blizzard technical support department in regards
to your question.  I know the same question has been asked by others in the
past and unfortunately there just is not information in regards to the game
that I have available to give besides what is already available on the internet.<br/>
Unfortunately I have no way to request any further information about the game or
items such as art resources or code from the game.</p>

<p>The best place I can suggest to post such a request is on our suggestions forum
at <a href="http://forums.battle.net/board.html?forumId=12016&amp;amp;sid=3000.">http://forums.battle.net/board.html?forumId=12016&amp;amp;sid=3000.</a>  This is by employees
that have more information, and more access to information than we do here in
technical support, if there is a large enough interest in anything then those ideas
are passed along to those that may be able to do more.  I cant guarantee anything
unfortunately but this is the best location I can suggest to try for such a request.</p>

<p>Unfortunately (though not unsurprisingly), Blizzard wouldn&rsquo;t release the code.</p>

<p>Now, once word got out that the complete game had been released (not legally I know &hellip;), I had to grab it and give it a shot.</p>

<p>Being a game from the late 90&rsquo;s, I didn&rsquo;t expect it to just work. My primary machines run Linux, so I first tried to run this through <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">wine</a>, which didn&rsquo;t end up working reliably.</p>

<p>I then built a Windows XP VM using VirtualBox. This managed to run
the game with no issues.</p>

<h3>Story</h3>

<p>As per the <a href="http://wow.gamepedia.com/Warcraft_Adventures:_Lord_of_the_Clans">Gamepedia</a> article:</p>

<p>Basically, after the Dark Portal was destroyed and the rift between the worlds was destroyed, you had a large group of orcs that were trapped on Azeroth. And over the course of the next few years, the humans, being merciful in their ways, instead of hunting down and eradicating these orcs, granted them land areas where they could live as long as they lived within the confines of societal expectations. Basically, they were put on these reservations or camps. And because they were made to live in a way that was very contrary to their basic nature, a lot of the spirit and fire that defines them as a culture was drained out of them. And so what you found yourself with was an orc society in Azeroth of forced passivity, not forced through violence but forced through situation.
Although down on their luck, the orcs in Warcraft Adventures were supposed to experience a rebirth, thanks to the leadership of Thrall.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/wca/wca.10.png"></p>

<p>Our storyline followed an orc baby that was taken from a battle scene where his parents were slain and raised by a human lieutenant, Blackmoore, with the intention of raising him with human ideals but being able to use him to control the orcs. Definitely someone who does not fit into the general stereotype of noble humans. He was a self-serving, dark human character who wanted to raise this orc, Thrall, our central character in the game, and use him to control and command the orcs and then raise them as his own private army. Thrall, though he&rsquo;s raised in captivity by humans to serve their will, still has some fire within him that he can&rsquo;t deny, so he rebels against his human owners. He escapes the compound where he&rsquo;s being held, and then over the course of the game, what we do is follow his adventures. As he discovers more about himself and the orcs and what it means to be an orc, so does the player. As you go through the game, you meet some familiar faces from the games, some in retirement, some trying to lead an underground resistance, and you learn of what happened to the Frost Wolf Clan, which was the clan that Thrall&rsquo;s father Durotan was a part of. You learn that Durotan, Blackhand and Doomhammer were three blood brothers, and that his clan Frost Wolf was sent into the Dwarf Highlands in the mountains. They were exiled there by a plotting Ner'zhul, when he was pulling the strings in the background behind Doom Hammer and Black Hand, because he knew that Durotan was a threat.</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<p>When I first started playing WCA, it was a nice trip down memory lane. The gameplay mechanics really seemed to borrow heavily from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Throttle_(1995_video_game)">Full Throttle</a>, which was one of my favourite point-and-click adventures in the &lsquo;90s.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/wca/wca.05.png"></p>

<p>Right-clicking brings up a graphical command menu that lets you talk, look or use.</p>

<p>You can interact with the environment based on designated hotspots (which are identified when hovered by showing a label).</p>

<p>Thrall will usually try to respond with a funny comment whenever possible, which makes it more compelling to click around and see what he has to say about his surroundings.</p>

<h3>Puzzles</h3>

<p>As with most adventure games of this era, the puzzles are predominantly fetch-quests and inventory manipulation quests. Again, if you grew up with these games this type of mechanic is old hat, but if you&rsquo;re new to the genre, this can seem a bit tedious.</p>

<p>I found that the puzzles were a bit on the easy side (until the last 10 minutes of the game). This could just be because I&rsquo;m used to these sorts of games, but until I need to dig around in the dragon&rsquo;s stomach for the pig&rsquo;s jetpack, everything was straightforward and I didn&rsquo;t feel the need to look to Google for the answer.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>As a throwback to &lsquo;90s point-and-click adventures, I&rsquo;d say WCA is worth playing. If you enjoyed the genre, this is a no brainer, and if you&rsquo;ve never played this type of game, this is a pretty easy entry.</p>

<p>The version of the game that was leaked is pretty close to being completed. I didn&rsquo;t notice any issues or major omissions.</p>

<p>The quality of the FMVs are pretty low compared to other games from the late &lsquo;90s. The pacing of the game isn&rsquo;t too slow and the story is interesting enough to make you want to see it through to the end.</p>

<p>Playing Warcraft Adventures actually made me want to revisit some other adventure games. I get the urge to play through Day of the Tentacle every 4-5 years or so, and I think it&rsquo;s been almost that long &hellip;</p>

        <updated>2016-09-05T14:08:29-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2016/09/05/summer-update-2016</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don&rsquo;t really have much progress to report for the last month, so I thought I&rsquo;d throw out a few of the games I&rsquo;ve been working through to see if I can generate any interest in the next article ;)</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/goldensun/goldensun.016.png"></p>

<p>First off, I&rsquo;ve been playing through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Sun">Golden Sun</a> for the GBA.</p>

<p>I really like the psyenergy system and how you use it for puzzle solving. It makes this game a bit more of an ARPG along the same lines as <a href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2015/09/23/just-finished-lufia-2/">Lufia 2</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made it as far as <a href="http://goldensun.wikia.com/wiki/Kraken">Kraken</a>, but I&rsquo;m finding beating him is proving to be more difficult that I&rsquo;d expected. Probably going to have to back out and grind for a while, which I don&rsquo;t have a lot of time for &hellip;</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/7th-saga/7th-saga.019.png"></p>

<p>Next, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ve given up on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7th_Saga">the 7th Saga</a>. I&rsquo;m still at Telaine with a party at level 17, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that to progress, there is grinding in my future.</p>

<p>Similar to the situation I&rsquo;m having above with Golden Sun, i just need to set many hours aside to level up in order to proceed, but with the amount of time I&rsquo;ve got these days to devote to these games, that may never happen.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Finally, I&rsquo;ve decided to bite the bullet and dive into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_RPG">Super Mario RPG</a>. This, along with Final Fantasy Tactics is one of those games that I&rsquo;ve heard nothing but good things about for the last 20 years, but have never bothered to investigate myself.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/mariorpg/mariorpg.011.png"></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently at level 10 with 3 star pieces recovered and have just rescued Princess Toadstool and had her join the party.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really enjoying the story and gameplay, but since this was developed by Square, I&rsquo;m not surprised that this is right up my alley :P</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m most likely going to be able to finish this game off, and then circle back around to Golden Sun, as I really want to beat that game.</p>

<p>Now, assuming I can make some progress on those two games, I&rsquo;d like to start getting some feedback on where to take this series next.</p>

<p>There are a number of games that I&rsquo;ve finished previously that I didn&rsquo;t write about. Some of the more notable ones would be:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_3">Mother 3</a></li>
<li>Final Fantasy VIII</li>
<li>Final Fantasy IX</li>
<li>Chrono Trigger</li>
</ul>


<p>Then there&rsquo;s the list of games that I really want to tackle, but since they all require a sizable time investment I&rsquo;m not sure which to hit up:</p>

<ul>
<li>Xenogears</li>
<li>Breath of Fire 3</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei:_Persona_3">Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3</a> - <em>I&rsquo;d likely play the PSP release</em></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danganronpa:_Trigger_Happy_Havoc">Danganronmpa</a> - <em>I started this a while back but never finished it</em></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_II">Shin Megami Tensei 2</a> - <em>There&rsquo;s a great fan translation of the Super Famicom release</em></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_IV:_The_After_Years">Final Fantasy IV: After Years</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagrant_Story">Vagrant Story</a></li>
</ul>


<p>If you&rsquo;ve got any insight into which I should tackle next, feel free to leave me a comment below ;)</p>

        <link href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2016/07/27/just-finished-dragon-quest-i/"/>
        <updated>2016-07-27T22:26:01-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2016/07/27/just-finished-dragon-quest-i</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I actually finished this game around the end of June, but haven&rsquo;t really had a chance to write about it until now. I&rsquo;m currently sitting out by the lake at the cottage and figured it was about time :P</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/dq1/dq1.000.png"></p>

<p>The last time I played through Dragon Quest was likely in the late 80&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I either heard about it, or got a copy of it through Nintendo Power, and like most kids in North America at the time, this would have been my first introduction to what would become known as JRPGs.</p>

<p>I decided to go with the SNES re-release of this title for my playthrough as I wanted some updated graphics and music. Although the SNES version was never officially localized for North America, there is an <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/translations/337/">excellent fan translation</a> available.</p>

<p>It threw me off a bit when they refer to the legendary hero as Roto (as opposed to Erdrick), but I&rsquo;m assuming this is a better translation than what we got in the 80&rsquo;s so that&rsquo;s probably what the name should have been in the first place.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/dq1/dq1.001.png"></p>

<p>Dragon Quest was essentially the first JRPG. As a result, there are a lot of concepts introduced here that would be adapted and refined by other titles and series over the years. This means that some parts of this game feel a bit rough or unbalanced.</p>

<p>I originally played the NES version of this title, and have fond memories of just how brutally hard it was. This game introduced me to what I would come to know as &ldquo;grinding&rdquo;, as you couldn&rsquo;t progress through the game unless your character was sufficiently leveled up in order to tackle the monsters in the areas you were exploring.</p>

<p>This meant walking back and forth and fighting random monsters.</p>

<p>Enemy encounter rates are high. Very high. I think the SNES version actually optimized this a bit, but the rates are still high. This is useful for grinding, but gets tedious when you want to explore, or really need to get back to a town to heal.</p>

<p>The story is pretty simple.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re the descendant of the legendary hero, and have been tasked with rescuing the princess and defeating the Dragon Lord.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/dq1/dq1.001.png"></p>

<p>To defeat the Dragon Lord, you need to get three pieces of equipment of the legendary hero which are scattered across the world.</p>

<p>Beat the dragon. Save the princess. Beat the Dragon Lord. Done.</p>

<p>Gameplay is pretty straightforward. You start off in the castle, where the king explains your quest. You can talk to people in the castle, or leave and move on to the nearest town.</p>

<p>Here you&rsquo;ll get a bit more info, or can buy supplies.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s kind of cool that the first time you leave the castle you can see the Dragon Lord&rsquo;s castle on the world map. This gives you your target right away and you know what you&rsquo;re working towards.</p>

<p>You interact with NPCs and the world via a command menu. One of the nice additions to the SNES version is that you no longer have to use a STAIRS command to go up and down stairs; just walk over them.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/dq1/dq1.012.png"></p>

<p>As you roam around the overworld and dungeouns, you&rsquo;ll get into random encounters. You interact with these using a command menu as well, where you can select to either attack, use magic, use an item, or run.</p>

<p>Dragon Quest is a pretty short game. Being one of the first of this genre it introduced a lot of gameplay elements that would shape the genre, but when you look at it as a standalone title, there&rsquo;s not all that much there.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t meant to be a knock at the game. I had a great time playing through it, but that playthrough was only a few hours.</p>

<p>I used an emulator to do this, so most of my level grinding was done in fast-forward, so it felt even faster to get through this title.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re playing the &ldquo;classics&rdquo;, I&rsquo;d definitely recommend this title. Playing these early games gives you more of an appreciation for the later RPGs, as well as giving you a feel for how it all started.</p>

<p>Have you had a chance to play this title? How do you think it holds up nowadays, especially with the release of the mobile ports? Have any DQ memories you want to share? Let me know in the comments.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun-gens/shadowrun.000.png"></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: 2016-09-05</strong> - It was pointed out on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/4uxq5n/just_gave_up_on_shadowrun_genesis">the Reddit thread</a> and in the comments below that I might have used a cheat which prevented finishing the game. I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d used one, but I think while doing research for the article i may have been testing it out :(</p>

<p>Note that you don&rsquo;t really need to cheat in this game to get more Nuyen; just grind ;)</p>

<p>Thanks to those who responded. It&rsquo;s worth noting that if you&rsquo;re going to play this game, <em>avoid the cheat menu</em> as it will bite you in the ass.</p>

<hr />

<p>As I work my way through the 8-bit and 16-bit games I grew up with, there are (and will continue to be) those that I just can&rsquo;t get through. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_(1994_video_game)">Shadowrun</a> for the Sega Genesis turned out to be one of those titles.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made it all the way to the final boss, and though he doesn&rsquo;t beat me, I empty all my clips (and my runner&rsquo;s clips) into him and just can&rsquo;t seem to kill him and trigger the endgame sequence.</p>

<p>This is extremely frustrating as I&rsquo;ve effectively finished this game, but if I can&rsquo;t beat the last boss I can&rsquo;t in good conscience call this a &ldquo;Just Finished&rdquo; article.</p>

<p>Regardless, I&rsquo;ve gone through enough of this game to be able to write about it, and based on my experience, recommend it to other players looking for some good retro cyberpunk action-RPG gaming.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun-gens/shadowrun.001.png"></p>

<p>This iteration of Shadowrun doesn&rsquo;t resemble the Super Nintendo&rsquo;s version of this title at all.</p>

<p>First off, you begin by selecting the type of player you want to run the game as: Samurai, Decker or Street Shaman. Each of these classes will give you different starting abilities and stats.</p>

<p>I chose to run as a Decker, as I wanted to get an idea as to how the matrix sequences differed between the games (plus I&rsquo;m a programmer and felt drawn to this class :P).</p>

<p>The story starts off with you at a hotel trying to track down some information about what happened to your brother. You interact with characters in this game through conversation trees (select A, B, C) in order to advance the story or get clues.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun-gens/shadowrun.002.png"></p>

<p>A good chunk of the game is presented through these conversation views.</p>

<p>Once you leave the hotel, you start on your adventure into the world of Shadowrun.</p>

<p>Your character can walk around the initial city and go in and out of various buildings in order to trigger additional conversations with NPCs. It&rsquo;s a good idea to get a lay of the land as you&rsquo;ll be visiting each of these building repeatedly once you start shadowrunning, so it&rsquo;s worth taking the time to explore.</p>

<p>Some buildings will warn you that they contain ghouls. These buildings are where you can go to do some level grinding, or if you&rsquo;re on a run that has you clearing out ghouls, earn some money.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun-gens/shadowrun.006.png"></p>

<p>To level grind, you&rsquo;ll just be earning karma points which can be applied to the various stats your character has. These stats affect your weapons skills, magic skills, tech/computer skills or your aptitude with various weapon classes.</p>

<p>Although I started out as a Decker, I found myself maxing out my weapon skills early on to make the game a lot easier to progress through. It turns out there really isn&rsquo;t any demand for low level Deckers, so I didn&rsquo;t really have an opportunity to do any Matrix runs until much later in the game.</p>

<p>On the subject of shadowruns, the way you earn money (nuyen) in this game is by taking on various jobs (runs) from Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s. There are one or more Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s in each city you visit and they offer you work. Initially the types of work are either &ldquo;escort <name> to <location>&rdquo;, &ldquo;take package to <location>&rdquo; or &ldquo;clear out ghouls from abandoned building&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun-gens/shadowrun.011.png"></p>

<p>I found that the easiest runs to make money at early on where the ghoul runs. You basically just go into the building, find some ghouls and start running in circles. They&rsquo;ll just follow you so you can pick them off one at a time.</p>

<p>Although this became tedious pretty quickly, you get money and karma and can level up your weapon stats in order to make repeating this easier.</p>

<p>The escort runs are easy, and if you took the time to get an idea where each target is, it&rsquo;s even easier to do. It just takes time and the payout isn&rsquo;t that great.</p>

<p>Eventually you&rsquo;ll earn enough money to buy some info about where to go next and you have the opportunity to travel to a new city.</p>

<p>There are a handful of cities you can visit in this game, and each one offers it&rsquo;s own set of challenges, as well as opportunities for more advanced runs.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll also meet other shadowrunners in bars and clubs throughout the game. These runners will give you more information about shadowrunning, the story, as well as background about the Shadowrun world.</p>

<p>These characters can also be hired to assist you on your runs. Each one has two rates; a single run rate or a lifetime rate.</p>

<p>I found I didn&rsquo;t really hire anyone until I hit the endgame as I didn&rsquo;t really need the help. If you&rsquo;re playing through the game as a shaman or samurai and don&rsquo;t bother upgrading your computer skills, it may be easier to hire a good decker than to upgrade your own stats and get a cyberdeck.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun-gens/shadowrun.009.png"></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll meet new Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s who offer more difficult missions that involve traveling between the various cities in order to do more difficult quests such as infiltrating corporations to either steal secrets or extract employees, or running the matrix.</p>

<p>Both of these advanced run types offer their own challenges and require abilities to be leveled up in order to proceed.</p>

<p>When infiltrating corporations, you&rsquo;ll need to be able to have electronics skills in order to be able to break maglocks, and you&rsquo;ll want your weapon skills upgraded so as to be able to shoot guards without attracting more.</p>

<p>The infiltration jobs have you going through multiple floors of these buildings, with each floor having guards to deal with, security cameras to avoid and wall safes to plunder.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun-gens/shadowrun.015.png"></p>

<p>It helps to have computer skills when doing these runs as you can hack the computers to disable cameras, turn off alarms and open doors.</p>

<p>This takes us to decking and matrix running.</p>

<p>Unlike the SNES version of this game, the Genesis version actually has a bit more depth to the matrix.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll need to have computer skills first, then also have computer software for fighting with subsystems and identifying and avoiding various threats.</p>

<p>The fighting itself is pretty repetitive, but the concept is fun.</p>

<p>There are various types of components within a matrix system. You have to hack each of these as you move deeper into the system. The end goal is usually to hit a data store and download or delete a file.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun-gens/shadowrun.021.png"></p>

<p>One way to easily earn money is to hack into a system, download the maximum number of data files then try to sell them to a contact in [city]. Near the end of the game i was able to get upwards of 10K for some files, which made upgrading my equipment a lot easier to do ;)</p>

<p>Although I&rsquo;ve been a huge fan of the SNES version of this game since I was a kid, I think I may have enjoyed the Genesis incarnation more. The music wasn&rsquo;t nearly as good, but the story was well laid out, there were a lot of options on how to progress and it didn&rsquo;t feel nearly as linear.</p>

<p>The addition of the classes gave you a sense of depth and replay-ability, though chances are you could just max out all stats for any player type and have same experience no matter how you started the game.</p>

<p>I also really enjoyed the shadowrunning aspect of this game. In the SNES version you could hire runners to help you get through the game, but you didn&rsquo;t actually participate in shadowruns for profit.</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t given this game a shot, I would highly recommend it. It turned out to be a lot of fun, and an excellent addition to the limited field of cyberpunk games out there.</p>

<p>If you have any recommendations for other games in this genre I should check out, or if you want to share your opinion on this or the SNES title, please feel free to leave me a comment.</p>

        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2016/07/25/extracting-best-rom-from-goodtools-generated-rom-sets</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a kid of the 80&rsquo;s, I have fond memories of all the old 8-bit and 16-bit consoles that I grew up with.</p>

<p>Although it&rsquo;s easy enough to find ROMs, I tend to find myself going for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoodTools">GoodTools</a> generated sets more often than not as they&rsquo;re considered &ldquo;complete&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This is kind of ridiculous as I don&rsquo;t speak Japanese, which constitutes the vast majority of the contents of these sets.</p>

<p>Even though most emulators support compressed ROM sets, I&rsquo;d prefer to just have the English ROMs available on their own in one place.</p>

<p>As a programmer, I thought &ldquo;How can I do this in Linux?&rdquo;, but more specifically, &ldquo;how do I do this from the command line directly?&rdquo;.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>If you find yourself with compressed ROM sets and you want to just grab the English ones, this might just come in handy ;)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I posted the <a href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2016/04/19/just-finished-seiken-densetsu-3/">Seiken Densetsu 3</a> review, so I figured as it might be a while before I get around to posting more content, I&rsquo;ll just throw up a quick update.</p>

<h2>Gaming</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun-gens/shadowrun.015.png"></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently working my way through three games. After finishing the <a href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2016/02/23/just-finished-shadowrun/">Shadowrun</a> play-through for SNES, I got some good feedback about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_(1994_video_game)">Genesis version</a>. I decided to give that a go, and I&rsquo;ve currently made it to the last boss, but am having no luck beating him.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m going to have to save up some nuyen and grind it out with some better runners in order to be able to beat Thon. This is a bit of a pain in the ass, and is the reason I ended up abandoning <a href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2015/01/16/just-finished-terranigma/">Terranigma</a> previously.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed that game, but since I&rsquo;ve got very limited time decided to move on to the next challenge.</p>

<p>By challenge, I meant <em>CHALLENGE</em>. I decided to give <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7th_Saga">The 7th Saga</a> another shot, and have now officially made it MUCH further than I ever have before.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/7th-saga/7th-saga.009.png"></p>

<p>This game was alway brutally hard for me when I was a kid, and it still is. You&rsquo;ve got limited inventory for healing items, everything is expensive and the enemies are generally overpowered.</p>

<p>On top of that, it takes forever to level up, and when you do it doesn&rsquo;t really make all that much of a difference.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made it as far as <a href="http://mikesrpgcenter.com/7thsaga/maps/telaine.html">Telaine</a> and have the Wind, Water and Star runes. Still a ways to go, but I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ll continue &hellip;</p>

<p>Finally, since I haven&rsquo;t played through this since the late &lsquo;80s, I&rsquo;m diving back into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest_(video_game)">Dragon Quest</a>. I&rsquo;m going to be playing through the fan-translated SNES port, which I think is the superior port (I don&rsquo;t like the mobile remakes of these games &hellip;).</p>

<p>I think I should have this one done relatively soon as it&rsquo;s not a very long game, and although it&rsquo;s a bit grind-heavy, I&rsquo;ve got 8x fast-forward on my emulator :P</p>

<h2>Anime</h2>

<p>Just a quick update on the series I&rsquo;ve burned through recently.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/17265/Log_Horizon">Log Horizon</a> - Season 1</strong></p>

<p>This reminded me or SAO a bit, but with a lot less &ldquo;Asuna! Kirito! <repeat>&rdquo;, and a lot more &ldquo;Lens flare from glasses&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pushing glasses back into place&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Story was enjoyable. Characters were interesting. I&rsquo;d recommend it.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/2025/Darker_than_Black__Kuro_no_Keiyakusha">Darker than Black</a> - Season 1+2</strong></p>

<p>REALLY enjoyed this. Good action. Interesting plot. Good dialog. I&rsquo;d recommend it.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/30276/One_Punch_Man">One Punch Man</a> - Season 1</strong></p>

<p>I LOVE this. Saitama is OP AF!!! The story is a bit goofy, but the characters are interesting and the plot keeps you interested. Would totally recommend this.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s all for now.</p>

        <link href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2016/04/19/just-finished-seiken-densetsu-3/"/>
        <updated>2016-04-19T14:30:20-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2016/04/19/just-finished-seiken-densetsu-3</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/sd3/sd3.026.png"></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiken_Densetsu_3">Seiken Densetsu 3 (聖剣伝説3)</a> is the third installment in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mana_(series)">Mana series</a>. It&rsquo;s the sequel to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_of_Mana">Secret of Mana</a>, which is the entry into the series that most North American gamers would be familiar with.</p>

<p>Once again, I played through this game on my phone using the fantastic <a href="http://www.explusalpha.com/home/snes9x-ex">Snes9x EX</a>. Please support this dev as he provides a fantastic product. For some reason though, most of the screenshots I took came out stretched. This hasn&rsquo;t happened before, and I&rsquo;ve been playing a couple other games that this isn&rsquo;t happening for either, so I&rsquo;ll chalk this up to bad luck :|</p>

<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/sd3/sd3.005.png"></p>

<p><em>NOTE</em> I ran these screenshots through <a href="http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/">pngcrush</a> (<code>ls *.png | while read line; do pngcrush -ow -brute $line; done</code>) to get the size down a bit ;)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m leaving these images in here as they were part of my &ldquo;journey&rdquo;, though hopefully they don&rsquo;t deter anyone from playing this game, as the game is <em>fantastic</em>.</p>

<p>First off, if you&rsquo;re a fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_of_Mana">Secret of Mana</a>, the initial &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of the game will be familiar, as will the art style and sound.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Whereas SoM had you gradually encounter the two other playable characters at set points in the game, SD3 has you selecting your 3 main characters before you even begin.</p>

<p>I decided to go with Duran, Carlie and Kevin (something about a werewolf named Kevin made me chuckle :P). Duran&rsquo;s story starts off with the castle where he lives being invaded by a wizard who almost kills him. The wizard lets Duran live, so naturally Duran has to set off on a quest to find and defeat the wizard.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/sd3/sd3.004.png"></p>

<p>On this journey, he&rsquo;ll run into the other characters I selected (Kevin and Carlie), and each of their stories will mix into Duran&rsquo;s. This is actually a really cool element of this game as it gives it a lot of replay value. No matter what combination of characters you pick, their stories will all overlap. Also, you&rsquo;ll run into all the other characters you didn&rsquo;t pick, so every character makes an appearance throughout the game.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/sd3/sd3.010.png"></p>

<p>You travel around the game mostly on foot initially, but eventually new methods of travel will open up. As with SoM, you can get to certain areas via Cannon Travel (though there&rsquo;s a couple of fetch-quests before you can actually take advantage of this). There&rsquo;s also a ship, a weird turtle thing, and eventually Flammie the dragon.</p>

<p>The combat system is reminiscent of SoM as well, though this time around it feels a lot more &ldquo;button mash-ey&rdquo;. I found that I just spammed the B button throughout most of this game and didn&rsquo;t really use any strategy during combat; aside from healing periodically.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/sd3/sd3.014.png"></p>

<p>You get experience by killing enemies, which will allow you to level up your characters. Leveling up lets you increase various stats, that should make your characters perform better in future battles.</p>

<p>As you make your way through the game, you&rsquo;ll start finding these pillars that are guarded by stronger enemies. These are the Mana stones, and apparently contain God-beasts that will be awakened if you shatter the stones.</p>

<p>These stones can also be used to change your character&rsquo;s class. This is another cool aspect of this game, as it give the leveling system a bit more flavour. You can change classes twice in this game; once at level 18, and again at level 38. Each of these classes is aligned with either &ldquo;Light&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dark&rdquo;, and gives the character new skills/improvements.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/sd3/sd3.017.png"></p>

<p>The game can feel a bit &ldquo;grindy&rdquo; due to the need to constantly trudge back and forth between areas, and there are enemies on each screen. These battles are all avoidable, but you&rsquo;ll want to level up for the boss fights, and eventually the God Beasts.</p>

<p>While you&rsquo;re trekking though, you get to enjoy some really good background music. If you like Secret of Mana, you&rsquo;ll love Seiken Densetsu 3. You can have a listen over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrywwZ7oL2w&amp;index=30&amp;list=PL4649F0DBF0FC09E3">YouTube</a> to get an idea what&rsquo;s in store for you ;)</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/sd3/sd3.031.png"></p>

<p>The artwork is also top notch. It&rsquo;s really a shame this game never made it to North America as this is possibly one of the best looking SNES games out there. The background design, character design and monster sprites are all very, very well done. There is a lot of variety to the various regions of the world.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve shattered all the Mana stones, you unleash the God Beasts. Their position is shown on the world map, and they can be fought in any order, but it&rsquo;s a good idea to start from the top left of the map and work your way through them sequentially.</p>

<p>I learned this the hard way as I only play this game on occasion, and ended up forgetting where I was. This resulted in A LOT of backtracking to find the last couple of beasts.</p>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game and would highly recommend this to anyone out there that likes JRPGs, action RPGs and 8/16-bit gaming in general. The graphics, music and gameplay are all very well done, and the story lines are interesting, even if there is occasionally some cheesy dialog :P</p>

<p>I finished this game over a month ago, so I&rsquo;m still pretty slow cranking out these reviews &hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently working my way through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7th_Saga">The 7th Saga</a> for SNES since I clearly need <em>more</em> pain and frustration in my life :P When that game is annoying me, I&rsquo;m also working on Sega Genesis version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_(1994_video_game)">Shadowrun</a>.</p>

<p>That game was recommended by some of my readers on Reddit so I figured I had to give it a whirl. So far I&rsquo;m actually really enjoying it, and it is VERY different the the SNES game of the same name.</p>

<p>Hopefully I&rsquo;ll have more for you in the near(er) future :)</p>

<p>As was made clear with the above info, there is steady demand for this book, so there must be quite a few plugin authors out there looking to get started with the Redmine platform.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to try to get my knowledgebase and dropbox plugins updated in the next couple of months, but if there is anything Redmine-related people might be interested, please leave your comments below ;)</p>

        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2016/02/23/just-finished-shadowrun</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had this game finished around Christmas, but I find my motivation for writing these articles is starting to languish. I&rsquo;m hoping to get that spark back with the next couple of titles i&rsquo;ll be tackling, even though Shadownrun was one of my favourite SNES games of all time.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun/shadowrun.001.png"></p>

<p>You wake up on a slab in the morgue. You don&rsquo;t know who you are or how you got there. That&rsquo;s pretty much all you&rsquo;ve got to go on when you start this game for the first time.</p>

<p>The intro shows you being gunned down, then a shapeshifter casts a spell on you and takes off. After getting out of the morgue, you run into &ldquo;Dog&rdquo;, who appears to be a shamanistic totem.</p>

<p>This was the first 10 minutes of this game, and I remember playing this back in &lsquo;94 and being hooked at this point.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_(1993_video_game)">Shadowrun</a> is a cyberpunk action-RPG for the Super Nintendo. You control Jake Armitage, a courier who has something important uploaded to his head computer.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>You move around in an isometric fashion. You can interact with certain people by talking to them, or occasionally giving them a key item from your inventory.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun/shadowrun.005.png"></p>

<p>When talking to NPCs, some words will appear in bold. These can then be used as keywords in future conversations. These NPC interactions are how the story is progressed, and you&rsquo;ll spend a fair amount of time in this menu over the course of the game.</p>

<p>Once you learn the <em>Hiring</em> keyword, you can also try to hire additional shadowrunners. When they join your team, they will fight along side you &hellip; for a while. If you&rsquo;ve increased your leadership levels, they may stay longer.</p>

<p>Leveling up is done by spending karma when you rest on a bed (which also acts as a save point). You can spend your karma to boost various stats, or to level up your spells once you learn magic.</p>

<p>Karma is gained by fighting, which is done by moving a set of cross-hairs across the screen, and when placed over an enemy, mashing the A button. You then fire, wait, fire, wait &hellip; etc.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun/shadowrun.010.png"></p>

<p>The combat in this game is pretty simple. Just stand in one place and fire. Once you&rsquo;re in combat mode, you can move your character, so there&rsquo;s not really any strategy (other than healing on occasion).</p>

<p>The same system is used for spells and items. You select the (spell/item) from the menu, the cursor becomes a hand icon, and you hover over your target and press a button again.</p>

<p>Navigating the screen using the D-pad can be a bit cumbersome; especially when fighting, but you get used to it after a while.</p>

<p>The game seems to be made up of a series of fetch quests that are used to get you from NPC to NPC in order to uncover more keywords, to then be used with other NPCs to trigger more fetch quests. Oh, and move the story along as well ;)</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun/shadowrun.006.png"></p>

<p>The game is split up into 3 main areas that you can navigate to by train, one area you get to by boat, and the volcano you get to by helicopter. These areas are all opened up as the story moves along and you slowly uncover who was responsible for trying to geek you at the beginning of the game.</p>

<p>As you fight your way through the various areas, you&rsquo;ll find out that you were a courier with sensitive information in your head computer. You have a datajack in your head which is not working, so you can&rsquo;t access your brain by computer in order to get this information.</p>

<p>When you go find a street doc to fix your datajack, it triggers a cortex bomb that then needs to be defused. After this is done, you get some information about what&rsquo;s in your head and you can start decking (hacking) into computers.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun/shadowrun.019.png"></p>

<p>The decking segments are actually pretty dumb, but I love them. This is really what has kept me going back to this game time and again over the years, as I just really loved the concept.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re physically wired into this machine, and have to battle various security countermeasures that have been installed in these systems. The battles are done by guessing when there is a hidden enemy on a grid and pressing the A button. Based on an RNG value and your computer skill level, you&rsquo;ll either miss or destroy the enemy.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s all there is to it. I still love it though :P</p>

<p>Depending on why you were hacking in, you&rsquo;ll either trigger an elevator or get part of a data file. The data files are plot devices that give you bits of the story, or contain phone numbers you can use from vidphones throughout the game.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun/shadowrun.024.png"></p>

<p>After you&rsquo;ve finally fought your way through the various sections of the game, you finally get to face off against Drake. He&rsquo;s apparently the one behind you almost being whacked. You beat him up, head back to Akimi building, fight your way up a handful of floors (fighting and decking) and finally find the AI you need to destroy.</p>

<p>Once done, things explode, and you can close the books on this adventure.</p>

<p>The game alludes to there being a potential sequel in the works, but this never materialized. There was another Shadownrun title for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_(1994_video_game)">Sega Genesis</a>, but this was a completely different game. I might play through this and do a write up one day, but I&rsquo;ve tried playing it a couple times over the years and could never get into it (if you think I should, or want to share an opinion, there is a comments section below &hellip; :P).</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun/shadowrun.027.png"></p>

<p>Overall I still love this game. This is where I was introduced to cyberpunk as a kid, and I even went as far as getting the Shadowrun books (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Never-Deal-Dragon-Shadownrun-Vol/dp/0451450787">Never Deal with a Dragon</a>) that this game was very loosely based on.</p>

<p>The music was also a fantastic complement to the dark atmosphere of the game. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ome6XI_KuIw&amp;list=PL2D5FC9FCF1AEF68C&amp;index=2">3AM On A Summer Night</a> might actually be one of my favourite tracks from the 16-bit era that wasn&rsquo;t composed by Nobuo Uematsu ;)</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re revisiting the SNES and looking for something you may have overlooked during the mid &lsquo;90s, pick this up and give it a spin.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
April, 1 2019: I've received a <em>LOT</em> of feedback on this article since it was published. I would like to point out that although the methods described here may still work, MongoDB introduced a <tt>--repair</tt> flag in 4.0.3 that simplifies this process significantly.

I would recommend reading their <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/recover-data-following-unexpected-shutdown">"Recover a Standalone after an Unexpected Shutdown"</a> tutorial to see if it applies to your recovery scenario.
</blockquote>


<p>Recently at work, we experienced a series of events that could have proven to be catastrophic for one of our datasets. We have a daily process that does daily cleanup, but relies on the presence of control data that is ETL&rsquo;d in from another process.</p>

<p>The secondary process failed, and as a result, <em>everything</em> was &ldquo;cleaned&rdquo; &hellip; aka, we purged an entire dataset.</p>

<p>This data happens to be on a 5 node replicaset (primary-secondary-secondary-arbiter-hidden), and the hidden node died over the holidays and I waited too long to recover it, so it was unable to ever catch up to the primary (always stuck in a RECOVERING state).</p>

<p>My incredible foresight (&hellip; laziness &hellip; ) resulted in us having a backup of the data ready to be extracted from the out of sync hidden node. All we had to do was start up <strong>mongod</strong> &hellip; right?</p>

<p>Aw crap. I could not for the life of me get the node back up and running. Since this was a replica-set member, I thought maybe if I just copied the failing file from the (working) primary it would just work. Apparently that&rsquo;s not the way MongoDB or WiredTiger works :P. Back to the drawing board.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I could see that my data directory contained a bunch of <code>collection-*.wt</code> and <code>index-*.wt</code> files, so I assumed these were the WiredTiger collection and index files. These are binary files so <code>grep</code>-ing didn&rsquo;t help me identify the collection I needed.</p>

<p>I wanted to next see if I could just copy the collection&rsquo;s backing file directly to a new (working) MongoDB installation, so I started up a new <code>mongod</code>, created a new collection with a document in it, then copied over any <code>collection-*.wt</code> file to see what would happen.</p>

<p>Guess what &hellip; didn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p><strong>Identify the WiredTiger collection&rsquo;s backing file</strong></p>

<p>Since we had access to a working node, plus the collection hadn&rsquo;t been dropped (just purged), I thought maybe the files on each node would be the same. I logged into the primary via the shell to get some info from my collection.</p>

<p>That <code>"uri" : "statistics:table:collection-7895--1435676552983097781"</code> entry looked promising.</p>

<p>I started hunting for a way to extract the data from this file without having to &ldquo;mount&rdquo; the file in another MongoDB installation, as I assumed this was not possible. I stumbled across a command line utility for WiredTiger that <a href="http://source.wiredtiger.com/2.7.0/command_line.html#util_salvage">happened to have a &lsquo;salvage&rsquo; command</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Salvaging the WiredTiger collection</strong></p>

<p>In order to use the <code>wt</code> utility, you have to build it from source. Being comfortable in Linux, this was not daunting ;)</p>

<pre><code>wget http://source.wiredtiger.com/releases/wiredtiger-2.7.0.tar.bz2
tar xvf wiredtiger-2.7.0.tar.bz2
cd wiredtiger-2.7.0
sudo apt-get install libsnappy-dev build-essential
./configure --enable-snappy
make
</code></pre>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> adding support for Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/google/snappy">snappy</a> compressor when building WiredTiger will save you some errors that I initially encountered when trying to salvage the data.</p>

<p>Now that I had a <code>wt</code> utility, I wanted to test it out on the collection file. It turns out that you need additional supporting files before you can do this. Once I&rsquo;d copied over the necessary files, my working directory (called <code>mongo-bak</code>) looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>-rw-r--r-- 1 root      root      4738772992 Feb  9 14:06 collection-2657--1723320556100349955.wt
-rw-r--r-- 1 root      root         1155072 Feb  9 14:05 _mdb_catalog.wt
-rw-r--r-- 1 root      root        26935296 Feb  9 14:05 sizeStorer.wt
-rw-r--r-- 1 root      root              95 Feb  9 14:05 storage.bson
-rw-r--r-- 1 root      root              46 Feb  9 14:04 WiredTiger
-rw-r--r-- 1 root      root             495 Feb  9 14:04 WiredTiger.basecfg
-rw-r--r-- 1 root      root              21 Feb  9 14:04 WiredTiger.lock
-rw-r--r-- 1 root      root             916 Feb  9 14:04 WiredTiger.turtle
-rw-r--r-- 1 root      root        10436608 Feb  9 14:04 WiredTiger.wt
</code></pre>

<p>Now, from the directory where we compiled WiredTiger, we started salvaging the collection:</p>

<pre><code>./wt -v -h ../mongo-bak -C "extensions=[./ext/compressors/snappy/.libs/libwiredtiger_snappy.so]" -R salvage collection-2657--1723320556100349955.wt
</code></pre>

<p>You know it&rsquo;s working if you see output along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>WT_SESSION.salvage 639400
</code></pre>

<p>which I believe is just counting up the number of documents recovered. Once the operation has completed, it will have overwritten the source <code>*.wt</code> collection file with whatever it could salvage.</p>

<p>The only issue is that you still can&rsquo;t load this into MongoDB yet.</p>

<p><strong>Importing the WiredTiger collection via dump/load into MongoDB</strong></p>

<p>In order to get the data into MongoDB, first we need to generate a dump file from the WiredTiger collection file. This is done using the <code>wt</code> utility:</p>

<pre><code>./wt -v -h ../data -C "extensions=[./ext/compressors/snappy/.libs/libwiredtiger_snappy.so]" -R dump -f ../collection.dump collection-2657--1723320556100349955
</code></pre>

<p>This operation produces no output, so you&rsquo;ll just have to sit tight and wait a while. You can always <code>watch ls -l</code> in another console if you want to make sure it&rsquo;s working ;)</p>

<p>Once completed, you&rsquo;ll have a <code>collection.dump</code> file, but this <em>still</em> can&rsquo;t be loaded directly into MongoDB. You can however, using the <code>wt</code> utility one more time, load the dump back into a WiredTiger collection.</p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s startup a new <code>mongod</code> instance that we can try this out on.</p>

<pre><code>mongod --dbpath tmp-mongo --storageEngine wiredTiger --nojournal
</code></pre>

<p>Next, let&rsquo;s connect to this instance via the mongo shell and create a new collection:</p>

<pre><code>use Recovery
db.borkedCollection.insert({test: 1})
db.borkedCollection.remove({})
db.borkedCollection.stats()
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;ve created a new db called <em>Recovery</em>, and inserted/removed a document so the collection&rsquo;s backing file would be generated. You can use the <code>stats()</code> method to get the collection name, but since we&rsquo;re only using one collection, it&rsquo;s easy enough to find just using <code>ls</code>.</p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;re going to take the backing file name of the collection we just created and use that to load our WiredTiger dump file:</p>

<pre><code>./wt -v -h ../data -C "extensions=[./ext/compressors/snappy/.libs/libwiredtiger_snappy.so]" -R load -f ../collection.dump -r collection-2-880383588247732034
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we drop the <code>.wt</code> extension from the collection file above. Also, the <code>-h</code> flag needs to point to the directory where our <code>mongod</code> has it&rsquo;s <code>dbPath</code>. Finally, <code>mongod</code> should not be running.</p>

<p>This operation also provides a progress indicator showing how much data has been loaded:</p>

<pre><code>table:collection-4--4286091263744514813: 1386220
</code></pre>

<p>Once completed, we can start <code>mongod</code> back up, shell in and have a look:</p>

<p>Well that&rsquo;s promising, but the collection still hasn&rsquo;t been <em>properly</em> restored yet.</p>

<p><strong>Restoring the MongoDB collection to a usable state</strong></p>

<p>This final part is pretty straightforward, as we&rsquo;re just going to do a <code>mongodump</code>, followed by a <code>mongorestore</code>.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> The <code>mongodump</code> will fail if you&rsquo;re using a version of MongoDB &lt; 3.2, as 3.2 is built against WiredTiger 2.7. I initially tested this using MongoDB 3.0.9 and the dump operation just returned 0 results.</p>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve dumped and reloaded the collection <em>yet again</em>, we can shell back in and validate that our recovery attempt has succeeded:</p>
