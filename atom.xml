        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write this post for a long time, as I officially got the royalty statement at the end of June, but I&rsquo;ve been a bit busy with life, contracts and the occasional 16-bit era JRPG &hellip;</p>

<p>As of this quarter, <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/redmine-plugin-extension-and-development/book">Redmine Plugin Extension and Development</a> is officially earning me money!</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/royalties-004.png"></p>

<p>Technically, the last statement was <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in_the_black">in the black</a>, however since the terms laid out by Packt Publishing only pays out royalties greater than £75, those earnings were rolled into this quarter.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve updated the table below with the numbers from the current quarter, but I&rsquo;d really like to thank everyone who&rsquo;s bought a copy of this book for supporting the <a href="http://www.redmine.org/">Redmine</a> project, and the vibrant plugin development community as well.</p>

        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2015/07/22/just-finished-final-fantasy-ii</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/ff2/ff2-box.jpg"></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited to finally be able to review this game, as it&rsquo;s the direct sequel to the game that got me into RPGs way back in 1990-91.</p>

<p>When I say Final Fantasy II, I literally mean the second game in the franchise; not the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_IV#North_American_localization">SNES translation of Final Fantasy IV</a> ;)</p>

<p>I actually played a bit of this game in the late 90&rsquo;s using the <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/translations/139/">Demiforce</a> translation patch (back in the good ol' <a href="http://bloodlust.zophar.net/NESticle/nes.html">NESticle</a> days :D), but didn&rsquo;t make it very far.</p>

<p>For the actual play-through, I decided to go with the <a href="http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_I_%26_II:_Dawn_of_Souls">Dawn of Souls</a> version for GBA, as this includes updated graphics, an &ldquo;official&rdquo; translation and an updated soundtrack.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Note that since I&rsquo;m reviewing a remake, I&rsquo;m not sure if some of the gameplay elements below were available in the original. If you happen to have actually completed the original NES version and spot an error, please let me know ;)</p>

<h4>Story</h4>


<p>The story is pretty standard JRPG fare. The Emperor of Palamecia is trying to take over the world. He summons some monsters that destroy the home town of Firion, Maria, Guy and Leon. The first three are rescued by a rebel faction and taken to another town (where they join the rebellion).</p>

<p>Leon goes missing. The party wants to find him. Off they go.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/ff2/ff2.010.png"></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll meet various characters along the way that will join your party and fight with you. (<strong>SPOILERS!</strong> they usually die by sacrificing themselves so you can continue the quest &hellip;)</p>

<p>As you go along, you find out more about the Emperors plan, fight with the Dark Knight who turns out the be Leon, have him join up with you and eventually make your way down to the castle of hell (aka Pandaemonium) to fight the Emperor.</p>

<h4>What's Cool</h4>


<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/ff2/ff2.004.png"></p>

<p>FFII introduces a couple of interesting gameplay elements that were not reused in any future entries in the series.</p>

<p>First, key character conversations allowed you to <em>Learn</em> keywords, which you could then <em>Ask</em> other key characters about. This mechanic helps advance the story as you have to ask various characters about plot points you learn as you go, and they then point you in the direction of your next objective.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/ff2/ff2.009.png"></p>

<p>FFII has multiple modes of travel on the overworld. As with the original, there are ships and an airship, but FFII introduces the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocobo">chocobo</a>.</p>

<p>There is also a bunch of &ldquo;cut-scenes&rdquo; added to this incarnation (which would not have been available in the original NES version). These are nice as they aren&rsquo;t excessive or long, but help advance the plot.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/ff2/ff2.005.png"></p>

<p>Instead of leveling up your characters by fighting and gaining EXP, FFII opted for a system where the more you use a skill, the better you get at it.</p>

<p>For example, the more Firion attacks with a sword, the higher his sword level would go. The more Maria uses the Cure spell, the higher her magic level &hellip; and Cure spell level would go.</p>

<p>This also applied to taking damage. The more damage a player took, the higher their strength and HP levels would go.</p>

<p>I thought this was a very interesting mechanic, and I&rsquo;m not really sure why this didn&rsquo;t make it into any future games.</p>

<h4>What's Not Cool</h4>


<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/ff2/ff2.019.png"></p>

<p>For some reason, this installation in the series decided to introduce an Inn system that charged based on how much healing you required. This proved to be a bit annoying until you realize it&rsquo;s a LOT cheaper to just use cure spells to get everyone&rsquo;s HP back up, THEN rest at the inn ;)</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/ff2/ff2.031.png"></p>

<p>Another annoyance is that throughout the game, in <em>any</em> dungeon you visit, there are doors that lead to empty rooms. LOTS of doors that lead to empty rooms. What&rsquo;s annoying is that these rooms have higher encounter rates, so the first step you take to head back towards the exit generally results in a battle.</p>

<p>The battles aren&rsquo;t necessarily difficult, it&rsquo;s just a pain in the ass to have to wade through all these useless rooms.</p>

<p>On battles in general, once again I&rsquo;m happy to be playing this game using an emulator, as the 8x fast-forward was my best friend.</p>

<p>The encounter rates in this game seem to be pretty high in most areas, and the fights are kind of sluggish. I found that for most non-boss fights, I&rsquo;d just hit fast-forward and hold down the A button (thankfully, you don&rsquo;t have to mash A in this game; just holding it down works :D).</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>


<p>Overall, I really enjoyed the game. The story (I feel) was much better than that of the original, or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_III">FF III</a> (not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VI">FF VI</a>, which is still my favourite installment in the series!)</p>

<p>I really liked the leveling system, and found that since I didn&rsquo;t run from many fights, I didn&rsquo;t have to game the system by just attacking my own party members to boost their HP/defense/stamina stats.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad I jumped back into the Final Fantasy series for a bit; especially with a game I actually haven&rsquo;t beaten before. Whenever I sit down with FF, it&rsquo;s usually either IV, VI or VII.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thinking the next Final Fantasy I tackle will likely be V, as I haven&rsquo;t previously finished this (though I&rsquo;ve gotten close). Not sure when that&rsquo;ll happen, because I&rsquo;m currently balls-deep in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufia_II:_Rise_of_the_Sinistrals">Lufia II</a> ;)</p>

<p>Note that since I&rsquo;ve finished the Dawn of Souls version of FFII, I have access to the <a href="http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Soul_of_Rebirth">Soul of Rebirth</a> additional dungeon.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to actually play this and add to this review, or just publish a minor post to cover what was added therein.</p>

        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2015/06/29/just-finished-breath-of-fire-2</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following on the heels of my playthrough of the original Breath of Fire, I&rsquo;ve just finished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breath_of_Fire_II">Breath of Fire II</a>.</p>

<p>Originally released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1994, BoF2 is the direct sequel to the original. Although the protagonist is named the same (Ryu) as in the original, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s supposed to be the same person (the story takes place hundreds of years after the original).</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/bof2/bof2.000.png"></p>

<p>You start off as a kid in a small town with your buddy Bow. You go visit the outskirts of town where there is a dragon sleeping and blocking a gate. You&rsquo;re attacked by a demon named Barubary, who knocks the two out then disappears.</p>

<p>The story picks up 10 years later with the two trying to make it as rangers and taking odd jobs. You take a job trying to find someone&rsquo;s lost pet, and from there, the game begins.</p>

<p>You save the pet (pig) in an old house where a hermit lives. This house introduces an interesting dynamic to the game as this becomes the location known as TownShip. As you make your may through the game, various people join your town or can be hired to improve it.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/bof2/bof2.002.png"></p>

<p>You can recruit builders, weapon/item shop keepers and magicians that teach you new skills and abilities. Also as your party grows, they can be stashed here in a big house and you can go talk to them at any point to get clues as to what needs to be done next.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The battle system is the same as the original, and most JRPGs of the era; enemies to the left, characters to the right. A menu system controls your actions, which should all be well known by now (Attack, Defend, Magic, Item, Run).</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/bof2/bof2.028.png"></p>

<p>As you progress, you will learn that Ryu is a member of the Dragon Clan (as was the case in the original BoF as well), and can learn to summon various dragons.</p>

<p>In BoF2, you don&rsquo;t need to venture too far off track in order to get the dragons. You actually get the majority of them in groups of three, which is convenient.</p>

<p>You meet a whole cast of characters that can join your party along the way, and each one has a special overworld ability that helps you progress the story.</p>

<p>For example, Sten can reach across some cliffs to grab a pole and drag the party across, Katt can smash rocks to open up pathways, Rand can roll into a ball and get you across vast stretches of the overworld without being attacked.</p>

<p>This last one is convenient as the random enemy encounter rate is pretty high in this game. I&rsquo;m really thankful I was playing this on an emulator that supported fast-forwarding, as the majority of the battles I just auto-fought at 800x speed ;)</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/bof2/bof2.012.png"></p>

<p>There are also multiple ways to get around the world. You can walk, ride on a whale, ride on a giant bird, or fly TownShip around. This last one, I didn&rsquo;t actually get to do as I killed the old guy hooked up to the machine on one of the quests :(.</p>

<p>While playing, depending on the decisions you make, you can affect the type of ending you&rsquo;ll get. Like some other RPGs (ex. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrono_Trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>), there are multiple endings you can get.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t get the best ending, but I didn&rsquo;t get the worst ending either (I chose to go into the gate and fight the end boss).</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/bof2/bof2.038.png"></p>

<p>BoF2 has a lot more &ldquo;cut scenes&rdquo; than the original did. I&rsquo;m not sure if this was the case on the SNES version, but as I was playing the GBA remake, this stood out for me.</p>

<p>The cut-scenes are just still images, but they do provide a nice break from the gameplay and tend to actually contribute to the story at hand (as opposed to just being randomly inserted).</p>

<p>The underlying story of the game is about a religious cult (St. Eva) that is sending souls to the ultimate evil. Once you infiltrate the cult and discover this plot, you can go to the underworld to fight Detheven, but first you have to beat the demon from the beginning of the game: Barubary.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/bof2/bof2.042.png"></p>

<p>You can choose to fight Barubary alone, or as a group. I believe the choice you make here influences the ending you get, but I&rsquo;m not positive &hellip;</p>

<p>I went it alone, and found it to be a very long, difficult fight. You basically have to attack once, heal once, repeat.</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;d knocked off about 3000 points of damage, I finally summoned a dragon to finish him off. This was the recommended strategy as the first few times I fought I used my dragon right away and had my ass kicked shortly thereafter. This <a href="http://shrines.rpgclassics.com/snes/bof2/walkthroughs/bof2walkb.txt">walkthrough</a> really helped ;)</p>

<p>The final battle with Detheven didn&rsquo;t prove to be all that difficult, and once you defeat him and the credits roll, Ryu chooses to take the form of a dragon and sacrifice himself to seal off the doorway to the underworld.</p>

<p>I quite enjoyed this game, though I did find the battle system to be excruciatingly slow. Without fast-forward on, I doubt I would have finished this game. Also, after a battle completes there is a delay before you can move your characters again, which also made the game feel sluggish.</p>

<p>Overall though, I would recommend this to any JRPG fan as the story is solid, the gameplay is fun, and if you like, you can take a break from the action and go fishing for treasure.</p>

<p>As usual, here&rsquo;s the gallery of screenshots. Let me know which one&rsquo;s your favourite in the comments below ;)</p>

<p>For my next playthrough, I&rsquo;m working on <a href="http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_I_%26_II:_Dawn_of_Souls">Final Fantasy II: Dawn of Souls</a>. Shouldn&rsquo;t be too much longer now, as I&rsquo;m already at the Jade Passage, which I believe is the final section of the game.</p>

<p>Did you like Breath of Fire II? Which is your favourite of the series? What should I play next? Is my writing getting any better? Let me know in the comments below if you have any feedback.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never really given <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> a fair chance. Every time I would go there, it seemed like the front page just had random links to news stories, or links to pictures.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t really bother to dive in and actually <em>look</em> for content, or bother to checkout the subreddits to see what sorts of communities I might be more inclined to interact with.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I took a couple of my articles from this blog and submitted them (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/39dg8d/just_finished_breath_of_fire/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/39fz7c/accessing_a_running_process_stdout/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/39g909/keeping_pry_breakpoints_out_of_git/">here</a>) to see what sort of feedback/engagement I might see.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/20150612-ga002.png"></p>

<p>Generally, I see anywhere from 5-25 users a day pass through here. That all changed very, VERY quickly once I submitted my content.</p>

<p>Within 12 hours of posting, I&rsquo;d managed to get up to ~ 900 unique users, and by the end of the day, it was over 1000! (<a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/its-over-9000">over 9000</a> would have been sweeter :P)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/20150612-ga001.png"></p>

<p>I had some really great conversations around my content, and got some useful feedback as well.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve posted content to Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and elsewhere, but never really got any good engagement. After this experience though, I know the first place I&rsquo;ll be dropping my new articles, and am even slightly more motivated to get them completed as I know what I can expect from the community :)</p>

<p>Please let me know if there are other communities you&rsquo;ve found that generate good conversations around your content.</p>

        <link href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2015/06/10/just-finished-breath-of-fire/"/>
        <updated>2015-06-10T08:34:06-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2015/06/10/just-finished-breath-of-fire</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My original plan for my next playthrough was going to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danganronpa:_Trigger_Happy_Havoc">Daganronpa</a>, but after making it to chapter 5, I got caught up in an phone upgrade bricking (at least <a href="http://mobilesyrup.com/2015/01/22/wind-mobile-users-complaining-of-problems-with-moto-x-lollipop-soak-test/">Wind ended up replacing my phone</a>) fiasco and lost all my progress.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t really feel like starting all over again, so I started <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufia_II:_Rise_of_the_Sinistrals">Lufia II</a> and the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breath_of_Fire_(video_game">Breath of Fire</a>.</p>

<p>I ended up sticking with Breath of Fire, though I want to get through both Lufia and Lufia II eventually ;)</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t really planning on writing about this game, but decided at the last minute, so all my screenshots are from the very end ;)</p>

<p>I played the Game Boy Advance remake on my phone using <a href="http://www.explusalpha.com/home/gba-emu">GBA.emu</a>. Although I&rsquo;m perfectly capable of compiling from source and side-loading the APK, I bought the version on the Play store as the developer deserves the support.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/bof/bof.005.png"></p>

<p>The story starts off the main character, Ryu&rsquo;s hometown. He is one of the last members of the Light Dragon Clan, and the Dark Dragon Clan has just come to eradicate them.</p>

<p>When they set the town ablaze, Ryu&rsquo;s sister Sara turns everyone to stone and ventures out alone to stop the invasion. She is captured, and the game begins with you setting out to fight the Dark Dragons and get her back.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/bof/bof.006.png"></p>

<p>As you make your way through the game, you meet up with additional character that add a new twist to how you solve puzzles. For example, Bo can hunt animals that appear randomly on the overworld map, Karn can open locked doors, Ox can smash certain walls, Gobi can swim under water and Nina eventually morphs into a bird.</p>

<p>I thought this angle was pretty cool, as it makes the game more of an Action-RPG (ala Zelda or Secret of Mana) than a traditional Final Fantasy style JRPG.</p>

<p>Each character has a unique skill that is required to progress the story at some point, so you feel more attached to them than supporting characters from certain other series.</p>

<p>The combat system is a traditional turn-based, menu-driven, pick your attacks and wait for the enemy implementation. If you&rsquo;ve played any other JRPG from this era, you&rsquo;ll feel right at home.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/bof/bof.000.png"></p>

<p>The main quest progresses in a pretty linear fashion. You&rsquo;re trying to find a bunch of Goddess keys that were used to lock up Tyr long ago, but the Dark dragons are trying to find them as well to let Tyr out to wreak havoc on the world.</p>

<p>You get these keys, fight members of the Dark Dragons, meet characters, unlock more of the map and eventually have to fight Tyr once and for all.</p>

<p>There are side-quests as well that you have to do if you want to learn dragon techniques for Ryu, or fusion techniques for Karn.</p>

<p>If you go to the trouble of getting all the Dragon equipment and finding the final dragon form, Agni, you basically have a Win Stick&trade; for the rest of the game (I highly recommend this :P).</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>This game wasn&rsquo;t overly difficult, and really didn&rsquo;t take that long to complete.</p>

<p>The learning curve wasn&rsquo;t very steep, but this could just be due to having played a lot of other games from the JRPG, Action RPG genres previously.</p>

<p>Since the majority of games that I play nowadays are from <a href="http://www.square-enix.com/">Square Enix</a>, it was nice to run through something from another publisher.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed this game, and am currently working my way through the sequel, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breath_of_Fire_II">Breath of Fire II</a>.</p>

<p>Assuming I don&rsquo;t brick my phone again, hopefully I&rsquo;ll have a review for that next :D.</p>

        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2015/05/14/fourth-royalty-statement</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been over a year since this book was published, and I didn&rsquo;t think it would see the type of success it has.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/20150329-001.png"></p>

<p>Based on this last statement, I&rsquo;m officially eligible to start collecting royalties off this book.</p>

<p>This will have to wait until next quarter as Packt only pays out if the total proceeds exceed £75; which the USD$78 I earned last quarter doesn&rsquo;t ;)</p>

<p><a href="http://redmine.org">Redmine</a> is a very popular open source project management platform, but in order to extend it users need to be familiar with not only the <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> language, but the <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> framework as well.</p>

<p>This can be quite the barrier to entry for new developers, as they need to have a fair amount of knowledge coming in.</p>

<p>Based on the sales figures I have access to, as well as feedback and inquiries I&rsquo;ve received over the last year, it&rsquo;s safe to say that the Redmine community is thriving :)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve updated the sales chart with my last royalty statement:</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re one of the people that bought the book, please leave a comment and let me know what you thought.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in the process of updating the <a href="https://github.com/alexbevi/redmine_knowledgebase">knowledgebase plugin</a> that served as the focal point of the book to be compatible with Redmine 3.0 and beyond. If you have any ideas for new features, or feel I should get cracking on the bug fixes, log an issue :)</p>

        <updated>2015-04-08T09:31:14-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2015/04/08/asylum-engine-update</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a number of years since I had a chance to look at this project, but recently I updated the codebase to the latest version (sync with upstream <a href="https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm">ScummVM</a>) and found that the videos no longer worked.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/20150408-004.png"></p>

<p>It turned out to be a pretty simple fix (see <a href="https://github.com/alexbevi/scummvm/commit/1ed45a5802a7ab9603aa72f8e18196e980657c23">commit</a>), but it rekindled my interest in the project.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I added some additional debug output and cleaned up the script debug loop so that there wasn&rsquo;t as much spamming of commands that were waiting for another event.</p>

<p>Also, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/xesf">@xesf</a>, we can now actually proceed up and down stairs via fixes he made to the script processor.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/20150408-003.png"></p>

<h2>TODO</h2>

<p><strong>better pathfinding</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/20150408-001.png"></p>

<p>The path-finding in the original engine is a lot smarter and more forgiving than our implementation.</p>

<p><strong>inventory management</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/20150408-002.png"></p>

<p>We can currently pick up an item and remove the graphic from the screen, but there&rsquo;s no way to retrieve/use items once collected.</p>

<p><strong>clean up graphical glitches</strong></p>

<p>There are still a number of clipping issues, as well as incorrect behaviour when Max is standing still (wrong animation might play).</p>

<p><strong>fix encounters</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/20150408-005.png"></p>

<p>Encounters load, but you can&rsquo;t interact with keywords yet.</p>

<p><strong>save/load</strong></p>

<p>There was quite a bit of work done on this, but we still need to verify that everything is being restored properly on load.</p>

        <link href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2015/02/06/block-retry-using-powershell/"/>
        <updated>2015-02-06T09:54:28-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2015/02/06/block-retry-using-powershell</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell">Powershell</a> scripting lately, and one of the features I&rsquo;ve really been pining for is the ability to apply some form of retry logic to either a function or a block.</p>

<p>Take the following sample:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='powershell'><span class='line'><span class="k">function</span> <span class="n">RandomlyFail</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nv">$rnd</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="nb">Get-Random</span> <span class="n">-minimum</span> <span class="n">1</span> <span class="n">-maximum</span> <span class="n">3</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$rnd</span> <span class="o">-eq</span> <span class="n">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="s2">&quot;OH NOES!!!&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nv">$Host</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">UI</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">WriteLine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;W00t!!!&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Depending on what the random number we get is, we&rsquo;ll get one of two scenarios:</p>

<pre><code># Success
RandomlyFail

W00t!!!

# Failure
RandomlyFail

OH NOES!!!
At line:62 char:9
+         throw "OH NOES!!!"
+         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : OperationStopped: (OH NOES!!!:String) [], RuntimeException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : OH NOES!!!
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if this happened to be part of a larger script and we didn&rsquo;t have everything wrapped in a <code>try..catch</code> block, execution could potentially stop there.</p>

<p>Since Powershell supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_%28computer_programming%29">closures</a>, we can write a function that accepts a <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2013/04/05/closures-in-powershell.aspx">script block</a> as a parameter.</p>

<!-- more -->




<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/34b700ff7c7c53c7780b.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;#
This function can be used to pass a ScriptBlock (closure) to be executed and returned.

The operation retried a few times on failure, and if the maximum threshold is surpassed, the operation fails completely.

Params:
    Command         - The ScriptBlock to be executed
    RetryDelay      - Number (in seconds) to wait between retries
                      (default: 5)
    MaxRetries      - Number of times to retry before accepting failure
                      (default: 5)
    VerboseOutput   - More info about internal processing
                      (default: false)
Examples:

Execute-With-Retry { $connection.Open() }
$result = Execute-With-Retry -RetryDelay 1 -MaxRetries 2 { $command.ExecuteReader() }
#&gt;
function Execute-With-Retry {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param(    
    [Parameter(ValueFromPipeline,Mandatory)]
    $Command,    
    $RetryDelay = 5,
    $MaxRetries = 5,
    $VerboseOutput = $false
    )
    
    $currentRetry = 0
    $success = $false
    $cmd = $Command.ToString()

    do {
        try
        {
            $result = &amp; $Command
            $success = $true
            if ($VerboseOutput -eq $true) {
                $Host.UI.WriteDebugLine(&quot;Successfully executed [$cmd]&quot;)
            }

            return $result
        }
        catch [System.Exception]
        {
            $currentRetry = $currentRetry + 1
                        
            if ($VerboseOutput -eq $true) {
                $Host.UI.WriteErrorLine(&quot;Failed to execute [$cmd]: &quot; + $_.Exception.Message)
            }
            
            if ($currentRetry -gt $MaxRetries) {                
                throw &quot;Could not execute [$cmd]. The error: &quot; + $_.Exception.ToString()
            } else {
                if ($VerboseOutput -eq $true) {
                    $Host.UI.WriteDebugLine(&quot;Waiting $RetryDelay second(s) before attempt #$currentRetry of [$cmd]&quot;)
                }
                Start-Sleep -s $RetryDelay
            }
        }
    } while (!$success);
}</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Now, if we retrofit our sample above:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='powershell'><span class='line'><span class="n">Execute-With-Retry</span> <span class="n">-RetryDelay</span> <span class="n">1</span> <span class="n">-VerboseOutput</span> <span class="nv">$true</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">RandomlyFail</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<pre><code>Failed to execute [ RandomlyFail ]: OH NOES!!!
DEBUG: Waiting 1 second(s) before attempt #1 of [ RandomlyFail ]

        <link href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2015/01/16/just-finished-terranigma/"/>
        <updated>2015-01-16T09:26:52-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2015/01/16/just-finished-terranigma</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As someone in their thirties with a family, my personal gaming time is somewhat limited. As a result, I need to be a bit more selective with what I choose to sink any free time into; and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinding_%28video_gaming%29">grinding</a> is not where I want that time to go. I&rsquo;ll get back to this shortly ;)</p>

<p>I want to start off by saying I really enjoyed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terranigma">Terranigma</a>. It&rsquo;s a fun 3rd person action-rpg (similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_A_Link_to_the_Past">Link to the Past</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_of_Mana">Secret of Mana</a>) that concludes the <em>Quintet</em> trilogy started by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_Blazer">Soul Blazer</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_Gaia">Illusion of Gaia</a>.</p>

<p>I was a big fan of Soul Blazer (less of Illusion of Gaia) so I was really looking forward to Terranigma. The gameplay is similar (real-time battle) and the themes are similar (restoring the world).</p>

<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/terranigma/Terranigma.000.png"></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>You start off by opening a funky box, which releases Yomi. I don&rsquo;t really know what he is, but the box he&rsquo;s in acts as your inventory system, as well as various settings and status pages. This is kind of innovative as it makes interacting with your items, weapons, armour and stats a bit more interesting.</p>

<p>First, you need to save your town, which gets frozen; except for the one guy who conveniently can explain how to unfreeze everyone.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/terranigma/Terranigma.002.png"></p>

<p>You go off to five different towers in order to &ldquo;free&rdquo; some of the villagers (kind of like you do in the dungeons of Soul Blazer &hellip;) who can then help you proceed through the remaining towers.</p>

<p>You save the town, say goodbye to your lifelong friend and jump into an abyss that transports you to the Lightside. There you continue resurrecting the world by going through towns and dungeons and killing baddies. Pretty simple &hellip; right?</p>

<p>WRONG!</p>

<p>I got stuck twice since I tried doing this without a walkthrough. The first place was Louran, since I forgot to pick up the scarf you needed in order to prove to the dog you knew his owner. I was stuck here for a very, very long time &hellip;</p>

<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/terranigma/Terranigma.002.png"></p>

<p>Second is <a href="http://shrines.rpgclassics.com/snes/terranigma/wsylvain.shtml">Sylvan Castle</a> in Spain. This is where I&rsquo;ve officially given up. I made it through the castle with no issues, but once you get to the boss, she just decimates you.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/terranigma/Terranigma.048.png"></p>

<p>Some walkthroughs say your should be at level 21, some say 25. I&rsquo;m at level 18. Grinding in this game takes a very long time, and I think I&rsquo;m just going to cut my losses here and move on.</p>

<p>If this were a turned-based RPG, I could blindly button mash my way up a few levels. Oh well.</p>

<p>From what I played though, Terranigma was a lot of fun. I may come back to this game, but for the moment I&rsquo;ve decided to move along to the next challenge &hellip; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danganronpa:_Trigger_Happy_Havoc">Danganronpa</a>. So far &hellip; loving it :D :D :D</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;d love to say Christmas came early this year, but it looks like sales of <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/redmine-plugin-extension-and-development/book">Redmine Plugin Extension and Development</a> didn&rsquo;t quite hit the numbers needed to actually result in a royalty cheque. Ah well, there&rsquo;s always Q1 of 2015 :D</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve added the latest numbers to those from <a href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2014/09/22/second-royalty-statement/">my previous post</a> in order to show the running total of units sold this year.</p>

<p>The main reason I&rsquo;ve been sharing these numbers (without sharing that actual &ldquo;numbers&rdquo;) is to show prospective authors what types of returns they can potentially expect.</p>

<p>The book I wrote falls into the &ldquo;minibook&rdquo; category, so the returns are lower than a full-on &ldquo;book&rdquo; (I think &lt; 100 pages is a minibook), but at this rate, 2015 might result in a non-negative royalty statement that I can share :)</p>

<p>Happy Holidays Everyone!!!</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just want to start off by saying how much I LOVE <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a>. I&rsquo;ve been working with it for a number of years now (coming from <a href="https://subversion.apache.org">Subversion</a> and sharing code on <a href="https://code.google.com">Google Code</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>) and have fully embraced <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> as the &ldquo;victor&rdquo; (IMHO) for both online source control and collaborative development.</p>

<p>The one &ldquo;downside&rdquo; to GitHub though is that you don&rsquo;t have the ability to manage a private repository for free. They do offer reasonable hosting plans, but I generally use private repos for client work or other professional backups.</p>

<p><a href="https://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a> on the other hand offers unlimited private repositories. They limit the collaborative features you have access to, but if you&rsquo;re strictly mirroring or backing up, that&rsquo;s not an issue.</p>

<p>In order to configure your repository to push to both, all you need to do is:</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> create a new repository on Bitbucket</p>

<p><strong>2a)</strong> edit the <code>.git/config</code> of your local repository</p>

<p><strong>2b)</strong> add a second <code>url</code> entry under the same <strong>remote</strong> as you&rsquo;re already pushing to</p>

<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/20141219-git-001.png"></p>

<p><strong>3)</strong> now to initialze the Bitbucket remote execute <code>git push origin -u --all</code>.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/20141219-git-002.png"></p>

<p>This will attempt to push all branches to the remote named <em>origin</em>. Since the version on GitHub is already up to date, the Bitbucket version will be initialized and all changes will be pushed.</p>

<p>Now, whenever you issue a <code>git push</code> command, both remote repositories will receive the changesets!</p>

        <updated>2014-10-17T09:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2014/10/17/just-finished-robotrek</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was planning on writing this review a while ago, but it turns out I nuked my phone and lost my progress so I had to start all over again. I originally started this on 2014-09-26, but I kind of lost my motivation &hellip; and I started playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terranigma">Terranigma</a>, which is pretty awesome so far.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/robotrek/220px-Robotrekboxart.jpg"></p>

<p>In my ongoing series of articles about old games that I never got around to playing, today I&rsquo;m going to tackle <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotrek">Robotrek</a>.</p>

<p>Robotrek is a silly RPG that revolves around &ldquo;getting to the bottom&rdquo; of a situation involving a group calling themselves the &ldquo;hackers&rdquo; who are disrupting the peace of your home town of Rococo.</p>

<p>The story follows your character, who wants to be an inventor, and right off the bat learns how to make robots. As you progress through the game, you&rsquo;ll eventually be able to build three robots, which can be swapped in an out during battle.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/robotrek/Robotrek_(USA).012.png"></p>

<p>These robots can be upgraded with better weapons and armour by reading books you find throughout the game.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll also learn how to make items and some useful tools that will help you solve various puzzles.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/robotrek/Robotrek_(USA).017.png"></p>

<p>Since you&rsquo;re an inventor in this game, one of your main tasks is to <em>combine</em> items you find in order to potentially make new items. Although this is useful a couple times, I found I didn&rsquo;t really need to use it beyond the first part of the game where you make the drill.</p>

<p>You can sometimes combine scraps with each other to produce weapons, or combine scraps with weapons to produce upgraded weapons, but only trial and error yield results. I couldn&rsquo;t find any information in the game that helped lead you towards proper combinations (and I wanted to avoid walkthroughs).</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/robotrek/Robotrek_(USA).027.png"></p>

<p>Battles in this game are pretty straightforward. You equip weapons to your robots, then use them in battle either directly, or you can program sequences that allow you to run multiple attacks in succession. This approach can kill enemies faster, but will require you to charge up for longer, and therefore be vulnerable for longer as well.</p>

<p>The fights are extremely repetitive, and it doesn&rsquo;t help that there only appears to be a single battle theme that loops constantly. I played most of the game with the volume off due to this :P</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/robotrek/Robotrek_(USA).010.png"></p>

<p>Once you get to the volcano and find the <em>Sword 4</em> in a chest, the random battles become exceedingly easy (for at least the next &frac34; of the game). This weapon is just ridiculously overpowered at this point and you&rsquo;ll find yourself just spamming it in order to quickly proceed through the story.</p>

<p>Boss battles tend to be very dependent on what level you&rsquo;re at when you enter the fight. Most battles I had to redo at least once as I found I was far too low of a level to have a chance.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/robotrek/Robotrek_(USA).022.png"></p>

<p>I found this to be the most true when I got to <strong>De Rose</strong>. This was the boss I reached during my last playthrough, and after grinding for a good 2 hours, I found I just couldn&rsquo;t beat her, gave up and moved on to another game.</p>

<p>This time around, I actually checked a walkthrough, which recommended I be at about level 50 before entering the fight. I was at level 37. I was going to have to grind &hellip; and grinding in this game is TEDIOUS. I ended up grinding to about level 44 before beating her, but this took a good 4-5 hours.</p>

<p>The story progresses: the Hackers leader (a crab) is defeated, Dr. Einst&rsquo;s plot is foiled, a new Hackers leader emerges (Blackmore), the story jumps back and forwards in time, a spaceship emerges so you can visit another planet and you end up having to save the world.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/robotrek/Robotrek_(USA).035.png"></p>

<p>The final battle is against Gateau (the &ldquo;food&rdquo;-naming convention for characters and places is used throughout the game), who had something to do with using the Tetron to build a weapon or something (I can&rsquo;t remember the exact story; play the game for a better description :P).</p>

<p>He takes two forms, but isn&rsquo;t overly difficult to defeat at this point.</p>

<p>Overall, this game was pretty easy. The story progressed in a very linear fashion, and most puzzles were pretty straightforward to solve.</p>

<p>It was fun though, and though I probably won&rsquo;t replay this game again in the future, I&rsquo;m glad that I went through it at least once.</p>

<p>My screenshots are below, though it seems that the emulator I was using (<a href="http://www.explusalpha.com/home/snes9x-ex">Snes9x EX</a> on my Moto G) overwrote some of my earlier images. Oh well. Enjoy :P</p>

<p><small>I hope to be done the <em>just finished &hellip;</em> article soon-ish &hellip;</small></p>

<p>Since I didn&rsquo;t really want to discard any, I figured I&rsquo;d just throw the execss screenshots into a carousel or gallery.</p>

<p>I found <a href="https://gist.github.com/kyv/5667902">an excellent example</a>, but it didn&rsquo;t quite produce the results I was looking for.</p>

<p>I ended up forking the gist in order to implement a Gallery tag for Jekyll/Octopress that could work with the <a href="http://galleria.io/">Galleria</a> jQuery plugin.</p>

<p>Now I can build a gallery from my extra screenshots by simply adding</p>

<p>Once again, I&rsquo;ve decided to remove the actual sales numbers from the statement, but I left in <em>TOTAL ROYALTIES TO BE PAID IN PERIOD</em> section. I did this to show the progress from time of publication to now in terms of how much of the advance has been consumed by <strong>ACTUAL</strong> sales.</p>

<p>At this rate, it&rsquo;s possible I&rsquo;ll see some additional money out of this title by the time 2014 is through .. which would be very exciting.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are others out there who have been approached by technical publications and asked to write about some topic or other. I&rsquo;m sure the numbers I&rsquo;m posting here will convince you it&rsquo;s not worth quitting your job and writing full time, but it looks like it <em>could</em> become profitable over time.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve had anything published and are seeing a decent return on your &ldquo;investment&rdquo;, please share in the comments ;)</p>

        <link href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2014/08/06/just-finished-fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones/"/>
        <updated>2014-08-06T17:58:55-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2014/08/06/just-finished-fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones.003.png"></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve played a lot of RPGs over the years (JRPGs mostly) but have somehow managed to hear little to nothing about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem">Fire Emblem</a> series.</p>

<p>My focus was mostly on the Final Fantasy series, as well as other Square-Enix properties so it&rsquo;s possible this is why :P</p>

<p>This post isn&rsquo;t really meant to be a review; it&rsquo;s more just my thoughts on the game right after I finished it as (a) I didn&rsquo;t take any notes, and (b) I started this playthrough over a year ago.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I&rsquo;m using this as an opportunity to get back into writing a bit more frequently, so I apologize in advance if the subject matter isn&rsquo;t covered very well, or if the writing is all over the place.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones.004.png"></p>

<p>I managed to complete the game in about 19 hours, so at least I managed to finish over an hour a month (which by gaming standards is terrible, but I&rsquo;m married with kids and have a job so <em>back off!</em> :P).</p>

<p>I played through on my Nexus 7 using <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.explusalpha.GbaEmu&amp;hl=en">GBA.emu</a> (which I would highly recommend buying to support the author), as I don&rsquo;t have an actual GBA (and prefer emulated games for convenience).</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones.002.png"></p>

<p>The game is turn-based tactical combat. You can buy equipment for your team members at various shops, and there is a &ldquo;world map&rdquo; that ties the various locations together. This makes is seem as though you&rsquo;re playing a board game.</p>

<p>The story is pretty straightforward: a dark force was sealed with a bunch of magic stones which were then distributed for safe keeping. Now someone wants to get these stones and re-awaken the dark force.</p>

<p>The goals of each map are either to defeat an enemy or capture a location. Along the way there are various NPC characters that you can either fight or try to persuade to join you.</p>

<p>Fight outcome is determined purely mathematically (stats, resources, weapon selection, character skill level, enemy skill level, terrain) and is presented as 2 avatars on the map with health guages underneath that deplete based on the result of the last &ldquo;turn&rdquo; of combat.</p>

<p>For some special battles, the characters are shown as their avatar representations and the fights are animated. These fights are generally plot advancement battles.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones.005.png"></p>

<p>Once of the main differentiating factors between Fire Emblem and other RPG series is &ldquo;permanent death&rdquo;. Once a character dies on the battle field, there is no way to revive them. This can make the game extremely difficult as you can potentially advance to a point where you cannot continue as you don&rsquo;t have enough players to clear a map without dying.</p>

<p>I found myself abusing save states as I didn&rsquo;t want my characters to die, and I didn&rsquo;t want to restart campaigns once I&rsquo;d progressed beyond a certain point (usually about 10 minutes &hellip;).</p>

<p>Overall I quite enjoyed the game. The story isn&rsquo;t terrible and there are enough characters to keep the campaigns interesting if you want or, if you&rsquo;re like me you stick with a core group of characters that end up being ridiculously over-leveled by the end.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones.000.png"></p>

<p>Once you finish the game, the final credits roll an epilogue unfolds that gives some final info about the characters that survived throughout the game. The characters that died in battle are also listed, and it summarizes where they died as well, which I thought was a nice touch.</p>

<p>I will likely take a stab at another entry in this series and take a bit more time (in game, not another year :P) to explore as I missed A LOT.</p>

<p>Once I finished the game I realized there was an entire Extras section where you can manage teams and practice battles (for points I think). Also I had a rogue with a members card and didn&rsquo;t notice any of the &ldquo;?&rdquo; shops until <em>after</em> beating the last area.</p>

<p>I also didn&rsquo;t spend much time in the optional dungeons, though I did use upgrade my characters to new classes whenever possible :) The next time I tackle a Fire Emblem title though I think I&rsquo;ll try to (a) explore more, (b) do more optional/side quests, &copy; NOT restart campaigns once they&rsquo;re underway.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently also midway through a playthrough of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotrek">Robotrek</a> which I&rsquo;ve been working on-again-off-again for about a year as well, so i may try to finish that off for the next <em>Just Finished&trade;</em> post.</p>

<p>If anyone has suggestions for an RPG, leave a comment (currently I&rsquo;m sticking with NES to PSP as the platform range).</p>

<p>If you want to retrofit a crontab or any other process to use the Logentries Token-TCP type log, just do the following:</p>

<pre><code>COMMAND | while read -r line; do echo "aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee $line" &gt; /dev/tcp/data.logentries.com/80; done
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee</code> is your log token, and <code>COMMAND</code> is whatever your like.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>lsblk | while read -r line; do echo "aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee $line" &gt; /dev/tcp/data.logentries.com/80; done

<p>A quick Google search came up dry, so I figured I&rsquo;d just roll my own.</p>

<p>In order to accomplish this, all that is required is to edit <code>source/_includes/post/sharing.html</code>:</p>

<p>The change above adds a snippit of Javascript that passes the current <code>site.url</code> and <code>page.url</code> in a similar fashion as is done for Twitter.</p>

<p>The Javascript source was generated using LinkedIn&rsquo;s <a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/plugins/share-plugin-generator">Share Plugin Generator</a>, so if the format of the one I&rsquo;ve chosen isn&rsquo;t to your liking, you can generate another.</p>

<p>Just in case you want to easily toggle this functionality, I&rsquo;ve also set it up to check for a configuration value in your site&rsquo;s <code>_config.yml</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Now, the next time your site is regenerated, a LinkedIn share button will be available.</p>

<p>This same method could be used to add pretty much any other social sharing sites you may want, as most should provide some form of widget generator.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick update on <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/redmine-plugin-extension-and-development/book">Redmine Plugin Extension and Development</a>. I received my first royalty statement today, which basically just indicates that not enough books have sold to exceed the advance I received initially.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/royalties20140331.png"></p>

<p>(I probably didn&rsquo;t need to redact anything from the image, but it seemed appropriate.)</p>

<p>The deal I had with Packt was that they&rsquo;d front me $600 against future sales, of which my cut is (I believe) ~ 16% of the list price.</p>

<p>Still a ways to go (sales-wise) before I would consider this a &ldquo;profitable&rdquo; venture, but it&rsquo;s nice to see that there is at least some initial interest.</p>

<p>I was approached by Packt a little while back to author another book, but based on the amount of time I invested in this one as well as the sales figures I&rsquo;m sharing here, I don&rsquo;t think it would be a good choice :P</p>

<p>Should I consider writing another book? Any thoughts out there from my fellow denizens of the interwebs?</p>

        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2014/07/07/subversion-plus-ruby-on-heroku-via-buildpacks</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2012, I wrote a post about <a href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2012/11/21/fetching-changesets-in-redmine-from-heroku-using-svn/">Redmine and Subversion on Heroku</a> that involved some funky hacks in order to build a working <code>svn</code> binary that could be uploaded as part of your Git payload.</p>

<p>This can be done a lot more cleanly by taking advantage of <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks">Heroku Buildpacks</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>All of the instructions I provided in my previous post can now be distilled into a single buildpack install command.</p>

<p>If we want to leverage an existing solution, we just add the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks">Subversion Buildpack</a> to our app.</p>

<p>The main &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo; here is that we can only have ONE buildpack defined at a time, which is problematic because our app&rsquo;s environment (Ruby, PHP, Node .. etc) is managed as a buildpack (see <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks</a> for more details).</p>

<p>In order to get around this limitation though, we can leverage another buildpack, known as the <a href="https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi">heroku-buildpack-multi</a> buildpack which allows us to define multiple buildpacks.</p>

<p>For our purposes, we&rsquo;re going to add Subversion and Ruby to our app:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd /path/to/app

$ heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi.git

$ cat .buildpacks
https://github.com/cucumber-ltd/heroku-buildpack-subversion.git
https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby.git

$ git commit .buildpacks -m "Add Buildpacks"
$ git push heroku master
</code></pre>

<p>This has helped me with my Redmine deployment on Heroku. Did it help you at all? Did I get something wrong. Let me know ;)</p>
