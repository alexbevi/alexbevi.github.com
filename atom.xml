<p>Although I&rsquo;m a huge fan of the point-and-click adventure genre, I&rsquo;ve been primarily focusing on covering 16-bit RPGs in my spare time. I&rsquo;ve still got a sizeable backlog to wade through, but when the news dropped that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_Adventures:_Lord_of_the_Clans">Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans</a> had been leaked, I couldn&rsquo;t resist.</p>

<p>Although no one really got a taste of this game until 2010 when MAN-biker posted some content to Youtube, I&rsquo;d been inquiring with Blizzard as early as 2008. I still have a copy of the email, so I&rsquo;ve trimmed it down a bit and shared it below.</p>

<p>My hope was to get access to the source code for the <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/">ScummVM</a> team to be able to incorporate as a custom engine.</p>

<p>Unfortunately (though not unsurprisingly), Blizzard wouldn&rsquo;t release the code.</p>

<p>Now, once word got out that the complete game had been released (not legally I know &hellip;), I had to grab it and give it a shot.</p>

<p>Being a game from the late 90&rsquo;s, I didn&rsquo;t expect it to just work. My primary machines run Linux, so I first tried to run this through <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">wine</a>, which didn&rsquo;t end up working reliably.</p>

<p>I then built a Windows XP VM using VirtualBox. This managed to run
the game with no issues.</p>

<h3>Story</h3>

<p>As per the <a href="http://wow.gamepedia.com/Warcraft_Adventures:_Lord_of_the_Clans">Gamepedia</a> article:</p>

<p>Basically, after the Dark Portal was destroyed and the rift between the worlds was destroyed, you had a large group of orcs that were trapped on Azeroth. And over the course of the next few years, the humans, being merciful in their ways, instead of hunting down and eradicating these orcs, granted them land areas where they could live as long as they lived within the confines of societal expectations. Basically, they were put on these reservations or camps. And because they were made to live in a way that was very contrary to their basic nature, a lot of the spirit and fire that defines them as a culture was drained out of them. And so what you found yourself with was an orc society in Azeroth of forced passivity, not forced through violence but forced through situation.
Although down on their luck, the orcs in Warcraft Adventures were supposed to experience a rebirth, thanks to the leadership of Thrall.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/wca/wca.10.png"></p>

<p>Our storyline followed an orc baby that was taken from a battle scene where his parents were slain and raised by a human lieutenant, Blackmoore, with the intention of raising him with human ideals but being able to use him to control the orcs. Definitely someone who does not fit into the general stereotype of noble humans. He was a self-serving, dark human character who wanted to raise this orc, Thrall, our central character in the game, and use him to control and command the orcs and then raise them as his own private army. Thrall, though he&rsquo;s raised in captivity by humans to serve their will, still has some fire within him that he can&rsquo;t deny, so he rebels against his human owners. He escapes the compound where he&rsquo;s being held, and then over the course of the game, what we do is follow his adventures. As he discovers more about himself and the orcs and what it means to be an orc, so does the player. As you go through the game, you meet some familiar faces from the games, some in retirement, some trying to lead an underground resistance, and you learn of what happened to the Frost Wolf Clan, which was the clan that Thrall&rsquo;s father Durotan was a part of. You learn that Durotan, Blackhand and Doomhammer were three blood brothers, and that his clan Frost Wolf was sent into the Dwarf Highlands in the mountains. They were exiled there by a plotting Ner'zhul, when he was pulling the strings in the background behind Doom Hammer and Black Hand, because he knew that Durotan was a threat.</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<p>When I first started playing WCA, it was a nice trip down memory lane. The gameplay mechanics really seemed to borrow heavily from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Throttle_(1995_video_game)">Full Throttle</a>, which was one of my favourite point-and-click adventures in the &lsquo;90s.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/wca/wca.05.png"></p>

<p>Right-clicking brings up a graphical command menu that lets you talk, look or use.</p>

<p>You can interact with the environment based on designated hotspots (which are identified when hovered by showing a label).</p>

<p>Thrall will usually try to respond with a funny comment whenever possible, which makes it more compelling to click around and see what he has to say about his surroundings.</p>

<h3>Puzzles</h3>

<p>As with most adventure games of this era, the puzzles are predominantly fetch-quests and inventory manipulation quests. Again, if you grew up with these games this type of mechanic is old hat, but if you&rsquo;re new to the genre, this can seem a bit tedious.</p>

<p>I found that the puzzles were a bit on the easy side (until the last 10 minutes of the game). This could just be because I&rsquo;m used to these sorts of games, but until I need to dig around in the dragon&rsquo;s stomach for the pig&rsquo;s jetpack, everything was straightforward and I didn&rsquo;t feel the need to look to Google for the answer.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>As a throwback to &lsquo;90s point-and-click adventures, I&rsquo;d say WCA is worth playing. If you enjoyed the genre, this is a no brainer, and if you&rsquo;ve never played this type of game, this is a pretty easy entry.</p>

<p>The version of the game that was leaked is pretty close to being completed. I didn&rsquo;t notice any issues or major omissions.</p>

<p>The quality of the FMVs are pretty low compared to other games from the late &lsquo;90s. The pacing of the game isn&rsquo;t too slow and the story is interesting enough to make you want to see it through to the end.</p>

<p>Playing Warcraft Adventures actually made me want to revisit some other adventure games. I get the urge to play through Day of the Tentacle every 4-5 years or so, and I think it&rsquo;s been almost that long &hellip;</p>

        <updated>2016-09-05T14:08:29-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2016/09/05/summer-update-2016</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don&rsquo;t really have much progress to report for the last month, so I thought I&rsquo;d throw out a few of the games I&rsquo;ve been working through to see if I can generate any interest in the next article ;)</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/goldensun/goldensun.016.png"></p>

<p>First off, I&rsquo;ve been playing through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Sun">Golden Sun</a> for the GBA.</p>

<p>I really like the psyenergy system and how you use it for puzzle solving. It makes this game a bit more of an ARPG along the same lines as <a href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2015/09/23/just-finished-lufia-2/">Lufia 2</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made it as far as <a href="http://goldensun.wikia.com/wiki/Kraken">Kraken</a>, but I&rsquo;m finding beating him is proving to be more difficult that I&rsquo;d expected. Probably going to have to back out and grind for a while, which I don&rsquo;t have a lot of time for &hellip;</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/7th-saga/7th-saga.019.png"></p>

<p>Next, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ve given up on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7th_Saga">the 7th Saga</a>. I&rsquo;m still at Telaine with a party at level 17, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that to progress, there is grinding in my future.</p>

<p>Similar to the situation I&rsquo;m having above with Golden Sun, i just need to set many hours aside to level up in order to proceed, but with the amount of time I&rsquo;ve got these days to devote to these games, that may never happen.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Finally, I&rsquo;ve decided to bite the bullet and dive into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_RPG">Super Mario RPG</a>. This, along with Final Fantasy Tactics is one of those games that I&rsquo;ve heard nothing but good things about for the last 20 years, but have never bothered to investigate myself.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/mariorpg/mariorpg.011.png"></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently at level 10 with 3 star pieces recovered and have just rescued Princess Toadstool and had her join the party.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really enjoying the story and gameplay, but since this was developed by Square, I&rsquo;m not surprised that this is right up my alley :P</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m most likely going to be able to finish this game off, and then circle back around to Golden Sun, as I really want to beat that game.</p>

<p>Now, assuming I can make some progress on those two games, I&rsquo;d like to start getting some feedback on where to take this series next.</p>

<p>There are a number of games that I&rsquo;ve finished previously that I didn&rsquo;t write about. Some of the more notable ones would be:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_3">Mother 3</a></li>
<li>Final Fantasy VIII</li>
<li>Final Fantasy IX</li>
<li>Chrono Trigger</li>
</ul>


<p>Then there&rsquo;s the list of games that I really want to tackle, but since they all require a sizable time investment I&rsquo;m not sure which to hit up:</p>

<ul>
<li>Xenogears</li>
<li>Breath of Fire 3</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei:_Persona_3">Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3</a> - <em>I&rsquo;d likely play the PSP release</em></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danganronpa:_Trigger_Happy_Havoc">Danganronmpa</a> - <em>I started this a while back but never finished it</em></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_II">Shin Megami Tensei 2</a> - <em>There&rsquo;s a great fan translation of the Super Famicom release</em></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_IV:_The_After_Years">Final Fantasy IV: After Years</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagrant_Story">Vagrant Story</a></li>
</ul>


<p>If you&rsquo;ve got any insight into which I should tackle next, feel free to leave me a comment below ;)</p>

        <link href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2016/07/27/just-finished-dragon-quest-i/"/>
        <updated>2016-07-27T22:26:01-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2016/07/27/just-finished-dragon-quest-i</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I actually finished this game around the end of June, but haven&rsquo;t really had a chance to write about it until now. I&rsquo;m currently sitting out by the lake at the cottage and figured it was about time :P</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/dq1/dq1.000.png"></p>

<p>The last time I played through Dragon Quest was likely in the late 80&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I either heard about it, or got a copy of it through Nintendo Power, and like most kids in North America at the time, this would have been my first introduction to what would become known as JRPGs.</p>

<p>I decided to go with the SNES re-release of this title for my playthrough as I wanted some updated graphics and music. Although the SNES version was never officially localized for North America, there is an <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/translations/337/">excellent fan translation</a> available.</p>

<p>It threw me off a bit when they refer to the legendary hero as Roto (as opposed to Erdrick), but I&rsquo;m assuming this is a better translation than what we got in the 80&rsquo;s so that&rsquo;s probably what the name should have been in the first place.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/dq1/dq1.001.png"></p>

<p>Dragon Quest was essentially the first JRPG. As a result, there are a lot of concepts introduced here that would be adapted and refined by other titles and series over the years. This means that some parts of this game feel a bit rough or unbalanced.</p>

<p>I originally played the NES version of this title, and have fond memories of just how brutally hard it was. This game introduced me to what I would come to know as &ldquo;grinding&rdquo;, as you couldn&rsquo;t progress through the game unless your character was sufficiently leveled up in order to tackle the monsters in the areas you were exploring.</p>

<p>This meant walking back and forth and fighting random monsters.</p>

<p>Enemy encounter rates are high. Very high. I think the SNES version actually optimized this a bit, but the rates are still high. This is useful for grinding, but gets tedious when you want to explore, or really need to get back to a town to heal.</p>

<p>The story is pretty simple.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re the descendant of the legendary hero, and have been tasked with rescuing the princess and defeating the Dragon Lord.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/dq1/dq1.001.png"></p>

<p>To defeat the Dragon Lord, you need to get three pieces of equipment of the legendary hero which are scattered across the world.</p>

<p>Beat the dragon. Save the princess. Beat the Dragon Lord. Done.</p>

<p>Gameplay is pretty straightforward. You start off in the castle, where the king explains your quest. You can talk to people in the castle, or leave and move on to the nearest town.</p>

<p>Here you&rsquo;ll get a bit more info, or can buy supplies.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s kind of cool that the first time you leave the castle you can see the Dragon Lord&rsquo;s castle on the world map. This gives you your target right away and you know what you&rsquo;re working towards.</p>

<p>You interact with NPCs and the world via a command menu. One of the nice additions to the SNES version is that you no longer have to use a STAIRS command to go up and down stairs; just walk over them.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/dq1/dq1.012.png"></p>

<p>As you roam around the overworld and dungeouns, you&rsquo;ll get into random encounters. You interact with these using a command menu as well, where you can select to either attack, use magic, use an item, or run.</p>

<p>Dragon Quest is a pretty short game. Being one of the first of this genre it introduced a lot of gameplay elements that would shape the genre, but when you look at it as a standalone title, there&rsquo;s not all that much there.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t meant to be a knock at the game. I had a great time playing through it, but that playthrough was only a few hours.</p>

<p>I used an emulator to do this, so most of my level grinding was done in fast-forward, so it felt even faster to get through this title.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re playing the &ldquo;classics&rdquo;, I&rsquo;d definitely recommend this title. Playing these early games gives you more of an appreciation for the later RPGs, as well as giving you a feel for how it all started.</p>

<p>Have you had a chance to play this title? How do you think it holds up nowadays, especially with the release of the mobile ports? Have any DQ memories you want to share? Let me know in the comments.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun-gens/shadowrun.000.png"></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: 2016-09-05</strong> - It was pointed out on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/4uxq5n/just_gave_up_on_shadowrun_genesis">the Reddit thread</a> and in the comments below that I might have used a cheat which prevented finishing the game. I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d used one, but I think while doing research for the article i may have been testing it out :(</p>

<p>Note that you don&rsquo;t really need to cheat in this game to get more Nuyen; just grind ;)</p>

<p>Thanks to those who responded. It&rsquo;s worth noting that if you&rsquo;re going to play this game, <em>avoid the cheat menu</em> as it will bite you in the ass.</p>

<hr />

<p>As I work my way through the 8-bit and 16-bit games I grew up with, there are (and will continue to be) those that I just can&rsquo;t get through. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_(1994_video_game)">Shadowrun</a> for the Sega Genesis turned out to be one of those titles.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made it all the way to the final boss, and though he doesn&rsquo;t beat me, I empty all my clips (and my runner&rsquo;s clips) into him and just can&rsquo;t seem to kill him and trigger the endgame sequence.</p>

<p>This is extremely frustrating as I&rsquo;ve effectively finished this game, but if I can&rsquo;t beat the last boss I can&rsquo;t in good conscience call this a &ldquo;Just Finished&rdquo; article.</p>

<p>Regardless, I&rsquo;ve gone through enough of this game to be able to write about it, and based on my experience, recommend it to other players looking for some good retro cyberpunk action-RPG gaming.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun-gens/shadowrun.001.png"></p>

<p>This iteration of Shadowrun doesn&rsquo;t resemble the Super Nintendo&rsquo;s version of this title at all.</p>

<p>First off, you begin by selecting the type of player you want to run the game as: Samurai, Decker or Street Shaman. Each of these classes will give you different starting abilities and stats.</p>

<p>I chose to run as a Decker, as I wanted to get an idea as to how the matrix sequences differed between the games (plus I&rsquo;m a programmer and felt drawn to this class :P).</p>

<p>The story starts off with you at a hotel trying to track down some information about what happened to your brother. You interact with characters in this game through conversation trees (select A, B, C) in order to advance the story or get clues.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun-gens/shadowrun.002.png"></p>

<p>A good chunk of the game is presented through these conversation views.</p>

<p>Once you leave the hotel, you start on your adventure into the world of Shadowrun.</p>

<p>Your character can walk around the initial city and go in and out of various buildings in order to trigger additional conversations with NPCs. It&rsquo;s a good idea to get a lay of the land as you&rsquo;ll be visiting each of these building repeatedly once you start shadowrunning, so it&rsquo;s worth taking the time to explore.</p>

<p>Some buildings will warn you that they contain ghouls. These buildings are where you can go to do some level grinding, or if you&rsquo;re on a run that has you clearing out ghouls, earn some money.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun-gens/shadowrun.006.png"></p>

<p>To level grind, you&rsquo;ll just be earning karma points which can be applied to the various stats your character has. These stats affect your weapons skills, magic skills, tech/computer skills or your aptitude with various weapon classes.</p>

<p>Although I started out as a Decker, I found myself maxing out my weapon skills early on to make the game a lot easier to progress through. It turns out there really isn&rsquo;t any demand for low level Deckers, so I didn&rsquo;t really have an opportunity to do any Matrix runs until much later in the game.</p>

<p>On the subject of shadowruns, the way you earn money (nuyen) in this game is by taking on various jobs (runs) from Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s. There are one or more Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s in each city you visit and they offer you work. Initially the types of work are either &ldquo;escort <name> to <location>&rdquo;, &ldquo;take package to <location>&rdquo; or &ldquo;clear out ghouls from abandoned building&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun-gens/shadowrun.011.png"></p>

<p>I found that the easiest runs to make money at early on where the ghoul runs. You basically just go into the building, find some ghouls and start running in circles. They&rsquo;ll just follow you so you can pick them off one at a time.</p>

<p>Although this became tedious pretty quickly, you get money and karma and can level up your weapon stats in order to make repeating this easier.</p>

<p>The escort runs are easy, and if you took the time to get an idea where each target is, it&rsquo;s even easier to do. It just takes time and the payout isn&rsquo;t that great.</p>

<p>Eventually you&rsquo;ll earn enough money to buy some info about where to go next and you have the opportunity to travel to a new city.</p>

<p>There are a handful of cities you can visit in this game, and each one offers it&rsquo;s own set of challenges, as well as opportunities for more advanced runs.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll also meet other shadowrunners in bars and clubs throughout the game. These runners will give you more information about shadowrunning, the story, as well as background about the Shadowrun world.</p>

<p>These characters can also be hired to assist you on your runs. Each one has two rates; a single run rate or a lifetime rate.</p>

<p>I found I didn&rsquo;t really hire anyone until I hit the endgame as I didn&rsquo;t really need the help. If you&rsquo;re playing through the game as a shaman or samurai and don&rsquo;t bother upgrading your computer skills, it may be easier to hire a good decker than to upgrade your own stats and get a cyberdeck.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun-gens/shadowrun.009.png"></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll meet new Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s who offer more difficult missions that involve traveling between the various cities in order to do more difficult quests such as infiltrating corporations to either steal secrets or extract employees, or running the matrix.</p>

<p>Both of these advanced run types offer their own challenges and require abilities to be leveled up in order to proceed.</p>

<p>When infiltrating corporations, you&rsquo;ll need to be able to have electronics skills in order to be able to break maglocks, and you&rsquo;ll want your weapon skills upgraded so as to be able to shoot guards without attracting more.</p>

<p>The infiltration jobs have you going through multiple floors of these buildings, with each floor having guards to deal with, security cameras to avoid and wall safes to plunder.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun-gens/shadowrun.015.png"></p>

<p>It helps to have computer skills when doing these runs as you can hack the computers to disable cameras, turn off alarms and open doors.</p>

<p>This takes us to decking and matrix running.</p>

<p>Unlike the SNES version of this game, the Genesis version actually has a bit more depth to the matrix.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll need to have computer skills first, then also have computer software for fighting with subsystems and identifying and avoiding various threats.</p>

<p>The fighting itself is pretty repetitive, but the concept is fun.</p>

<p>There are various types of components within a matrix system. You have to hack each of these as you move deeper into the system. The end goal is usually to hit a data store and download or delete a file.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun-gens/shadowrun.021.png"></p>

<p>One way to easily earn money is to hack into a system, download the maximum number of data files then try to sell them to a contact in [city]. Near the end of the game i was able to get upwards of 10K for some files, which made upgrading my equipment a lot easier to do ;)</p>

<p>Although I&rsquo;ve been a huge fan of the SNES version of this game since I was a kid, I think I may have enjoyed the Genesis incarnation more. The music wasn&rsquo;t nearly as good, but the story was well laid out, there were a lot of options on how to progress and it didn&rsquo;t feel nearly as linear.</p>

<p>The addition of the classes gave you a sense of depth and replay-ability, though chances are you could just max out all stats for any player type and have same experience no matter how you started the game.</p>

<p>I also really enjoyed the shadowrunning aspect of this game. In the SNES version you could hire runners to help you get through the game, but you didn&rsquo;t actually participate in shadowruns for profit.</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t given this game a shot, I would highly recommend it. It turned out to be a lot of fun, and an excellent addition to the limited field of cyberpunk games out there.</p>

<p>If you have any recommendations for other games in this genre I should check out, or if you want to share your opinion on this or the SNES title, please feel free to leave me a comment.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a kid of the 80&rsquo;s, I have fond memories of all the old 8-bit and 16-bit consoles that I grew up with.</p>

<p>Although it&rsquo;s easy enough to find ROMs, I tend to find myself going for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoodTools">GoodTools</a> generated sets more often than not as they&rsquo;re considered &ldquo;complete&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This is kind of ridiculous as I don&rsquo;t speak Japanese, which constitutes the vast majority of the contents of these sets.</p>

<p>Even though most emulators support compressed ROM sets, I&rsquo;d prefer to just have the English ROMs available on their own in one place.</p>

<p>As a programmer, I thought &ldquo;How can I do this in Linux?&rdquo;, but more specifically, &ldquo;how do I do this from the command line directly?&rdquo;.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>If you find yourself with compressed ROM sets and you want to just grab the English ones, this might just come in handy ;)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I posted the <a href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2016/04/19/just-finished-seiken-densetsu-3/">Seiken Densetsu 3</a> review, so I figured as it might be a while before I get around to posting more content, I&rsquo;ll just throw up a quick update.</p>

<h2>Gaming</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun-gens/shadowrun.015.png"></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently working my way through three games. After finishing the <a href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2016/02/23/just-finished-shadowrun/">Shadowrun</a> play-through for SNES, I got some good feedback about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_(1994_video_game)">Genesis version</a>. I decided to give that a go, and I&rsquo;ve currently made it to the last boss, but am having no luck beating him.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m going to have to save up some nuyen and grind it out with some better runners in order to be able to beat Thon. This is a bit of a pain in the ass, and is the reason I ended up abandoning <a href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2015/01/16/just-finished-terranigma/">Terranigma</a> previously.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed that game, but since I&rsquo;ve got very limited time decided to move on to the next challenge.</p>

<p>By challenge, I meant <em>CHALLENGE</em>. I decided to give <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7th_Saga">The 7th Saga</a> another shot, and have now officially made it MUCH further than I ever have before.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/7th-saga/7th-saga.009.png"></p>

<p>This game was alway brutally hard for me when I was a kid, and it still is. You&rsquo;ve got limited inventory for healing items, everything is expensive and the enemies are generally overpowered.</p>

<p>On top of that, it takes forever to level up, and when you do it doesn&rsquo;t really make all that much of a difference.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made it as far as <a href="http://mikesrpgcenter.com/7thsaga/maps/telaine.html">Telaine</a> and have the Wind, Water and Star runes. Still a ways to go, but I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ll continue &hellip;</p>

<p>Finally, since I haven&rsquo;t played through this since the late &lsquo;80s, I&rsquo;m diving back into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest_(video_game)">Dragon Quest</a>. I&rsquo;m going to be playing through the fan-translated SNES port, which I think is the superior port (I don&rsquo;t like the mobile remakes of these games &hellip;).</p>

<p>I think I should have this one done relatively soon as it&rsquo;s not a very long game, and although it&rsquo;s a bit grind-heavy, I&rsquo;ve got 8x fast-forward on my emulator :P</p>

<h2>Anime</h2>

<p>Just a quick update on the series I&rsquo;ve burned through recently.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/17265/Log_Horizon">Log Horizon</a> - Season 1</strong></p>

<p>This reminded me or SAO a bit, but with a lot less &ldquo;Asuna! Kirito! <repeat>&rdquo;, and a lot more &ldquo;Lens flare from glasses&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pushing glasses back into place&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Story was enjoyable. Characters were interesting. I&rsquo;d recommend it.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/2025/Darker_than_Black__Kuro_no_Keiyakusha">Darker than Black</a> - Season 1+2</strong></p>

<p>REALLY enjoyed this. Good action. Interesting plot. Good dialog. I&rsquo;d recommend it.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/30276/One_Punch_Man">One Punch Man</a> - Season 1</strong></p>

<p>I LOVE this. Saitama is OP AF!!! The story is a bit goofy, but the characters are interesting and the plot keeps you interested. Would totally recommend this.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s all for now.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/sd3/sd3.026.png"></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiken_Densetsu_3">Seiken Densetsu 3 (聖剣伝説3)</a> is the third installment in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mana_(series)">Mana series</a>. It&rsquo;s the sequel to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_of_Mana">Secret of Mana</a>, which is the entry into the series that most North American gamers would be familiar with.</p>

<p>Once again, I played through this game on my phone using the fantastic <a href="http://www.explusalpha.com/home/snes9x-ex">Snes9x EX</a>. Please support this dev as he provides a fantastic product. For some reason though, most of the screenshots I took came out stretched. This hasn&rsquo;t happened before, and I&rsquo;ve been playing a couple other games that this isn&rsquo;t happening for either, so I&rsquo;ll chalk this up to bad luck :|</p>

<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/sd3/sd3.005.png"></p>

<p><em>NOTE</em> I ran these screenshots through <a href="http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/">pngcrush</a> (<code>ls *.png | while read line; do pngcrush -ow -brute $line; done</code>) to get the size down a bit ;)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m leaving these images in here as they were part of my &ldquo;journey&rdquo;, though hopefully they don&rsquo;t deter anyone from playing this game, as the game is <em>fantastic</em>.</p>

<p>First off, if you&rsquo;re a fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_of_Mana">Secret of Mana</a>, the initial &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of the game will be familiar, as will the art style and sound.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Whereas SoM had you gradually encounter the two other playable characters at set points in the game, SD3 has you selecting your 3 main characters before you even begin.</p>

<p>I decided to go with Duran, Carlie and Kevin (something about a werewolf named Kevin made me chuckle :P). Duran&rsquo;s story starts off with the castle where he lives being invaded by a wizard who almost kills him. The wizard lets Duran live, so naturally Duran has to set off on a quest to find and defeat the wizard.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/sd3/sd3.004.png"></p>

<p>On this journey, he&rsquo;ll run into the other characters I selected (Kevin and Carlie), and each of their stories will mix into Duran&rsquo;s. This is actually a really cool element of this game as it gives it a lot of replay value. No matter what combination of characters you pick, their stories will all overlap. Also, you&rsquo;ll run into all the other characters you didn&rsquo;t pick, so every character makes an appearance throughout the game.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/sd3/sd3.010.png"></p>

<p>You travel around the game mostly on foot initially, but eventually new methods of travel will open up. As with SoM, you can get to certain areas via Cannon Travel (though there&rsquo;s a couple of fetch-quests before you can actually take advantage of this). There&rsquo;s also a ship, a weird turtle thing, and eventually Flammie the dragon.</p>

<p>The combat system is reminiscent of SoM as well, though this time around it feels a lot more &ldquo;button mash-ey&rdquo;. I found that I just spammed the B button throughout most of this game and didn&rsquo;t really use any strategy during combat; aside from healing periodically.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/sd3/sd3.014.png"></p>

<p>You get experience by killing enemies, which will allow you to level up your characters. Leveling up lets you increase various stats, that should make your characters perform better in future battles.</p>

<p>As you make your way through the game, you&rsquo;ll start finding these pillars that are guarded by stronger enemies. These are the Mana stones, and apparently contain God-beasts that will be awakened if you shatter the stones.</p>

<p>These stones can also be used to change your character&rsquo;s class. This is another cool aspect of this game, as it give the leveling system a bit more flavour. You can change classes twice in this game; once at level 18, and again at level 38. Each of these classes is aligned with either &ldquo;Light&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dark&rdquo;, and gives the character new skills/improvements.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/sd3/sd3.017.png"></p>

<p>The game can feel a bit &ldquo;grindy&rdquo; due to the need to constantly trudge back and forth between areas, and there are enemies on each screen. These battles are all avoidable, but you&rsquo;ll want to level up for the boss fights, and eventually the God Beasts.</p>

<p>While you&rsquo;re trekking though, you get to enjoy some really good background music. If you like Secret of Mana, you&rsquo;ll love Seiken Densetsu 3. You can have a listen over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrywwZ7oL2w&amp;index=30&amp;list=PL4649F0DBF0FC09E3">YouTube</a> to get an idea what&rsquo;s in store for you ;)</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/sd3/sd3.031.png"></p>

<p>The artwork is also top notch. It&rsquo;s really a shame this game never made it to North America as this is possibly one of the best looking SNES games out there. The background design, character design and monster sprites are all very, very well done. There is a lot of variety to the various regions of the world.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve shattered all the Mana stones, you unleash the God Beasts. Their position is shown on the world map, and they can be fought in any order, but it&rsquo;s a good idea to start from the top left of the map and work your way through them sequentially.</p>

<p>I learned this the hard way as I only play this game on occasion, and ended up forgetting where I was. This resulted in A LOT of backtracking to find the last couple of beasts.</p>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game and would highly recommend this to anyone out there that likes JRPGs, action RPGs and 8/16-bit gaming in general. The graphics, music and gameplay are all very well done, and the story lines are interesting, even if there is occasionally some cheesy dialog :P</p>

<p>I finished this game over a month ago, so I&rsquo;m still pretty slow cranking out these reviews &hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently working my way through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7th_Saga">The 7th Saga</a> for SNES since I clearly need <em>more</em> pain and frustration in my life :P When that game is annoying me, I&rsquo;m also working on Sega Genesis version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_(1994_video_game)">Shadowrun</a>.</p>

<p>That game was recommended by some of my readers on Reddit so I figured I had to give it a whirl. So far I&rsquo;m actually really enjoying it, and it is VERY different the the SNES game of the same name.</p>

<p>Hopefully I&rsquo;ll have more for you in the near(er) future :)</p>

<p>As was made clear with the above info, there is steady demand for this book, so there must be quite a few plugin authors out there looking to get started with the Redmine platform.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to try to get my knowledgebase and dropbox plugins updated in the next couple of months, but if there is anything Redmine-related people might be interested, please leave your comments below ;)</p>

        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2016/02/23/just-finished-shadowrun</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had this game finished around Christmas, but I find my motivation for writing these articles is starting to languish. I&rsquo;m hoping to get that spark back with the next couple of titles i&rsquo;ll be tackling, even though Shadownrun was one of my favourite SNES games of all time.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun/shadowrun.001.png"></p>

<p>You wake up on a slab in the morgue. You don&rsquo;t know who you are or how you got there. That&rsquo;s pretty much all you&rsquo;ve got to go on when you start this game for the first time.</p>

<p>The intro shows you being gunned down, then a shapeshifter casts a spell on you and takes off. After getting out of the morgue, you run into &ldquo;Dog&rdquo;, who appears to be a shamanistic totem.</p>

<p>This was the first 10 minutes of this game, and I remember playing this back in &lsquo;94 and being hooked at this point.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_(1993_video_game)">Shadowrun</a> is a cyberpunk action-RPG for the Super Nintendo. You control Jake Armitage, a courier who has something important uploaded to his head computer.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>You move around in an isometric fashion. You can interact with certain people by talking to them, or occasionally giving them a key item from your inventory.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun/shadowrun.005.png"></p>

<p>When talking to NPCs, some words will appear in bold. These can then be used as keywords in future conversations. These NPC interactions are how the story is progressed, and you&rsquo;ll spend a fair amount of time in this menu over the course of the game.</p>

<p>Once you learn the <em>Hiring</em> keyword, you can also try to hire additional shadowrunners. When they join your team, they will fight along side you &hellip; for a while. If you&rsquo;ve increased your leadership levels, they may stay longer.</p>

<p>Leveling up is done by spending karma when you rest on a bed (which also acts as a save point). You can spend your karma to boost various stats, or to level up your spells once you learn magic.</p>

<p>Karma is gained by fighting, which is done by moving a set of cross-hairs across the screen, and when placed over an enemy, mashing the A button. You then fire, wait, fire, wait &hellip; etc.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun/shadowrun.010.png"></p>

<p>The combat in this game is pretty simple. Just stand in one place and fire. Once you&rsquo;re in combat mode, you can move your character, so there&rsquo;s not really any strategy (other than healing on occasion).</p>

<p>The same system is used for spells and items. You select the (spell/item) from the menu, the cursor becomes a hand icon, and you hover over your target and press a button again.</p>

<p>Navigating the screen using the D-pad can be a bit cumbersome; especially when fighting, but you get used to it after a while.</p>

<p>The game seems to be made up of a series of fetch quests that are used to get you from NPC to NPC in order to uncover more keywords, to then be used with other NPCs to trigger more fetch quests. Oh, and move the story along as well ;)</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun/shadowrun.006.png"></p>

<p>The game is split up into 3 main areas that you can navigate to by train, one area you get to by boat, and the volcano you get to by helicopter. These areas are all opened up as the story moves along and you slowly uncover who was responsible for trying to geek you at the beginning of the game.</p>

<p>As you fight your way through the various areas, you&rsquo;ll find out that you were a courier with sensitive information in your head computer. You have a datajack in your head which is not working, so you can&rsquo;t access your brain by computer in order to get this information.</p>

<p>When you go find a street doc to fix your datajack, it triggers a cortex bomb that then needs to be defused. After this is done, you get some information about what&rsquo;s in your head and you can start decking (hacking) into computers.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun/shadowrun.019.png"></p>

<p>The decking segments are actually pretty dumb, but I love them. This is really what has kept me going back to this game time and again over the years, as I just really loved the concept.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re physically wired into this machine, and have to battle various security countermeasures that have been installed in these systems. The battles are done by guessing when there is a hidden enemy on a grid and pressing the A button. Based on an RNG value and your computer skill level, you&rsquo;ll either miss or destroy the enemy.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s all there is to it. I still love it though :P</p>

<p>Depending on why you were hacking in, you&rsquo;ll either trigger an elevator or get part of a data file. The data files are plot devices that give you bits of the story, or contain phone numbers you can use from vidphones throughout the game.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun/shadowrun.024.png"></p>

<p>After you&rsquo;ve finally fought your way through the various sections of the game, you finally get to face off against Drake. He&rsquo;s apparently the one behind you almost being whacked. You beat him up, head back to Akimi building, fight your way up a handful of floors (fighting and decking) and finally find the AI you need to destroy.</p>

<p>Once done, things explode, and you can close the books on this adventure.</p>

<p>The game alludes to there being a potential sequel in the works, but this never materialized. There was another Shadownrun title for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_(1994_video_game)">Sega Genesis</a>, but this was a completely different game. I might play through this and do a write up one day, but I&rsquo;ve tried playing it a couple times over the years and could never get into it (if you think I should, or want to share an opinion, there is a comments section below &hellip; :P).</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/shadowrun/shadowrun.027.png"></p>

<p>Overall I still love this game. This is where I was introduced to cyberpunk as a kid, and I even went as far as getting the Shadowrun books (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Never-Deal-Dragon-Shadownrun-Vol/dp/0451450787">Never Deal with a Dragon</a>) that this game was very loosely based on.</p>

<p>The music was also a fantastic complement to the dark atmosphere of the game. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ome6XI_KuIw&amp;list=PL2D5FC9FCF1AEF68C&amp;index=2">3AM On A Summer Night</a> might actually be one of my favourite tracks from the 16-bit era that wasn&rsquo;t composed by Nobuo Uematsu ;)</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re revisiting the SNES and looking for something you may have overlooked during the mid &lsquo;90s, pick this up and give it a spin.</p>

We have a daily process that does daily cleanup, but relies on the presence of control data that is ETL&rsquo;d in from another process.</p>

<p>The secondary process failed, and as a result, <em>everything</em> was &ldquo;cleaned&rdquo; &hellip; aka, we purged an entire dataset.</p>

<p>This data happens to be on a 5 node replicaset (primary-secondary-secondary-arbiter-hidden), and the hidden node died over the holidays and I waited too long to recover it, so it was unable to ever catch up to the primary (always stuck in a RECOVERING state).</p>

<p>My incredible foresight (&hellip; laziness &hellip; ) resulted in us having a backup of the data ready to be extracted from the out of sync hidden node. All we had to do was start up <strong>mongod</strong> &hellip; right?</p>

<p>Aw crap. I could not for the life of me get the node back up and running. Since this was a replica-set member, I thought maybe if I just copied the failing file from the (working) primary it would just work. Apparently that&rsquo;s not the way MongoDB or WiredTiger works :P. Back to the drawing board.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I could see that my data directory contained a bunch of <code>collection-*.wt</code> and <code>index-*.wt</code> files, so I assumed these were the WiredTiger collection and index files. These are binary files so <code>grep</code>-ing didn&rsquo;t help me identify the collection I needed.</p>

<p>I wanted to next see if I could just copy the collection&rsquo;s backing file directly to a new (working) MongoDB installation, so I started up a new <code>mongod</code>, created a new collection with a document in it, then copied over any <code>collection-*.wt</code> file to see what would happen.</p>

<p>Guess what &hellip; didn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p><strong>Identify the WiredTiger collection&rsquo;s backing file</strong></p>

<p>Since we had access to a working node, plus the collection hadn&rsquo;t been dropped (just purged), I thought maybe the files on each node would be the same. I logged into the primary via the shell to get some info from my collection.</p>

<p>That <code>"uri" : "statistics:table:collection-7895--1435676552983097781"</code> entry looked promising.</p>

<p>I started hunting for a way to extract the data from this file without having to &ldquo;mount&rdquo; the file in another MongoDB installation, as I assumed this was not possible. I stumbled across a command line utility for WiredTiger that <a href="http://source.wiredtiger.com/2.7.0/command_line.html#util_salvage">happened to have a &lsquo;salvage&rsquo; command</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Salvaging the WiredTiger collection</strong></p>

<p>In order to use the <code>wt</code> utility, you have to build it from source. Being comfortable in Linux, this was not daunting ;)</p>

<pre><code>wget http://source.wiredtiger.com/releases/wiredtiger-2.7.0.tar.bz2
tar xvf wiredtiger-2.7.0.tar.bz2
cd wiredtiger-2.7.0
sudo apt-get install libsnappy-dev build-essential
./configure --enable-snappy
make
</code></pre>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> adding support for Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/google/snappy">snappy</a> compressor when building WiredTiger will save you some errors that I initially encountered when trying to salvage the data.</p>

<p>Now that I had a <code>wt</code> utility, I wanted to test it out on the collection file. It turns out that you need additional supporting files before you can do this. Once I&rsquo;d copied over the necessary files, my working directory (called <code>mongo-bak</code>) looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>-rw-r--r-- 1 root      root      4738772992 Feb  9 14:06 collection-2657--1723320556100349955.wt
-rw-r--r-- 1 root      root         1155072 Feb  9 14:05 _mdb_catalog.wt
-rw-r--r-- 1 root      root        26935296 Feb  9 14:05 sizeStorer.wt
-rw-r--r-- 1 root      root              95 Feb  9 14:05 storage.bson
-rw-r--r-- 1 root      root              46 Feb  9 14:04 WiredTiger
-rw-r--r-- 1 root      root             495 Feb  9 14:04 WiredTiger.basecfg
-rw-r--r-- 1 root      root              21 Feb  9 14:04 WiredTiger.lock
-rw-r--r-- 1 root      root             916 Feb  9 14:04 WiredTiger.turtle
-rw-r--r-- 1 root      root        10436608 Feb  9 14:04 WiredTiger.wt
</code></pre>

<p>Now, from the directory where we compiled WiredTiger, we started salvaging the collection:</p>

<pre><code>./wt -v -h ../mongo-bak -C "extensions=[./ext/compressors/snappy/.libs/libwiredtiger_snappy.so]" -R salvage collection-2657--1723320556100349955.wt
</code></pre>

<p>You know it&rsquo;s working if you see output along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>WT_SESSION.salvage 639400             
</code></pre>

<p>which I believe is just counting up the number of documents recovered. Once the operation has completed, it will have overwritten the source <code>*.wt</code> collection file with whatever it could salvage.</p>

<p>The only issue is that you still can&rsquo;t load this into MongoDB yet.</p>

<p><strong>Importing the WiredTiger collection via dump/load into MongoDB</strong></p>

<p>In order to get the data into MongoDB, first we need to generate a dump file from the WiredTiger collection file. This is done using the <code>wt</code> utility:</p>

<pre><code>./wt -v -h ../data -C "extensions=[./ext/compressors/snappy/.libs/libwiredtiger_snappy.so]" -R dump -f ../collection.dump collection-2657--1723320556100349955
</code></pre>

<p>This operation produces no output, so you&rsquo;ll just have to sit tight and wait a while. You can always <code>watch ls -l</code> in another console if you want to make sure it&rsquo;s working ;)</p>

<p>Once completed, you&rsquo;ll have a <code>collection.dump</code> file, but this <em>still</em> can&rsquo;t be loaded directly into MongoDB. You can however, using the <code>wt</code> utility one more time, load the dump back into a WiredTiger collection.</p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s startup a new <code>mongod</code> instance that we can try this out on.</p>

<pre><code>mongod --dbpath tmp-mongo --storageEngine wiredTiger --nojournal                                  
</code></pre>

<p>Next, let&rsquo;s connect to this instance via the mongo shell and create a new collection:</p>

<pre><code>use Recovery
db.borkedCollection.insert({test: 1})
db.borkedCollection.remove({})
db.borkedCollection.stats()
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;ve created a new db called <em>Recovery</em>, and inserted/removed a document so the collection&rsquo;s backing file would be generated. You can use the <code>stats()</code> method to get the collection name, but since we&rsquo;re only using one collection, it&rsquo;s easy enough to find just using <code>ls</code>.</p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;re going to take the backing file name of the collection we just created and use that to load our WiredTiger dump file:</p>

<pre><code>./wt -v -h ../data -C "extensions=[./ext/compressors/snappy/.libs/libwiredtiger_snappy.so]" -R load -f ../collection.dump -r collection-2-880383588247732034
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we drop the <code>.wt</code> extension from the collection file above. Also, the <code>-h</code> flag needs to point to the directory where our <code>mongod</code> has it&rsquo;s <code>dbPath</code>. Finally, <code>mongod</code> should not be running.</p>

<p>This operation also provides a progress indicator showing how much data has been loaded:</p>

<pre><code>table:collection-4--4286091263744514813: 1386220
</code></pre>

<p>Once completed, we can start <code>mongod</code> back up, shell in and have a look:</p>

<p>Well that&rsquo;s promising, but the collection still hasn&rsquo;t been <em>properly</em> restored yet.</p>

<p><strong>Restoring the MongoDB collection to a usable state</strong></p>

<p>This final part is pretty straightforward, as we&rsquo;re just going to do a <code>mongodump</code>, followed by a <code>mongorestore</code>.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> The <code>mongodump</code> will fail if you&rsquo;re using a version of MongoDB &lt; 3.2, as 3.2 is built against WiredTiger 2.7. I initially tested this using MongoDB 3.0.9 and the dump operation just returned 0 results.</p>

<p>Occasionally we&rsquo;ll run into these scenarios where we need to load the <code>system.js</code> functions into the global context, but for whatever reason one (or more) scripts are borked.</p>

<p>I created on that essentially looks like the following to illustrate this point.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When you try to execute a <code>db.loadServerScripts()</code> call, the entire process will fail as there is a malformed script.</p>

<p>This is a major pain in the ass when you have large background processes that rely heavily on internal system scripts.</p>

<p>In order to address this, we wrote a small script that you can run against any database to validate the internal scripts:</p>

        <updated>2015-11-07T19:15:57-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2015/11/07/just-finished-final-fantasy-v</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/ffv/ffv.001.png"></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been waiting write this review for a very long time. I love the Final Fantasy series, and although I got the original back in &lsquo;90, I didn&rsquo;t really fall in love with the series until I played IV for the SNES. Then I played VI. Then I was REALLY hooked.</p>

<p>Since I didn&rsquo;t grow up in Japan, FF IV and VI were numbered II and III when I first got my hands on them. This means that I didn&rsquo;t know there was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_V">Final Fantasy V</a>; at least not until much later.</p>

<p>The game starts off with the king of Tycoon heading off to check on the wind crystal, only to watch it shatter. The hero Bartz (Butz when I played the fan translation :P) sees a meteorite fall from the sky and heads off to investigate. Bartz and his Chocobo go to check it out, and find an old man who&rsquo;s suffering from amnesia.</p>

<p>The king&rsquo;s daughter, Lenna, heads out to find her father and runs into Bartz and Galuf. They team up and the adventure begins.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/ffv/ffv.003.png"></p>

<p>Once at the wind shrine, they find that the crystal has shattered and within each shard is the power of a job class.</p>

<p>This introduces you to the job ability system. If you&rsquo;ve ever had a chance to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_III">Final Fantasy III</a>, you&rsquo;ve see this system in action, but in FFV, it&rsquo;s done to perfection :)</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Each character can be assigned to a job class. As they defeat enemies, they gain ability points, which levels up the job class. As the classes level up, you gain abilities associated with that class.</p>

<p>These abilities can then be applied to a character regardless of the class they&rsquo;re assigned to. For example, you can give a white mage black magic abilities (if you&rsquo;ve leveled up a black mage for that character).</p>

<p>This gives you a lot of control over how you build your characters as the game progresses.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/ffv/ffv.002.png"></p>

<p>The storytelling in this game is very well done. Although the plot is pretty standard Final Fantasy fare (crystals, amnesia, evil emperor, main characters dying), the writing was pretty good and the character emotion pop-ups added a nice touch as well.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the elements of comedy they tried to incorporate into some of the scenarios and characters. After playing this game, Gilgamesh is probably my new favourite non-player character in the series. This might also have to do with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CMTXyExkeI">Clash on the Big Bridge</a>
being my favourite song from this game ;)</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/ffv/ffv.022.png"></p>

<p>The battle system is the same as in FFIV (<a href="http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_System#Active_Time_Battle">Active Time Battle system</a>). You can fight, use items, or up to 2 abilities you&rsquo;ve learned from gaining AP and leveling up your classes.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t find the battles overly difficult during this play-through, but I&rsquo;ve been focusing a lot on grinding in the last few games I&rsquo;ve covered, so this could just be a result of me over leveling.</p>

<p>So as you progress through the game, you discover that the ultimate evil, Exdeath, was banished to your world by the four warriors of dawn. Now you and your party need to become the new warriors of dawn to fight him again.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/ffv/ffv.046.png"></p>

<p>You have to get the ultimate weapons for each character class, you can go on some side quests to get some powerful summons and eventually go after Exdeath.</p>

<p>There is one fight in Exdeath&rsquo;s tower that I just couldn&rsquo;t win, and that was <a href="http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Shinryu_(Final_Fantasy_V">Shinryu</a>). I didn&rsquo;t bother to upgrade my equipment after a while as I just hoarded my money to use Gil Toss against everybody. As a result, Shinryu just decimated me every time I tried &hellip; so I just gave up.</p>

<p>I found that magic and summons in this game proved to be effective until the very end. This is different than my experience with FF II, where you bust your ass to get Ultima, then it does like 900 damage to enemies (even after being leveled up a few times :|).</p>

<p>I thought the story was really compelling, and I found the whole alternate worlds overlapping &ldquo;thing&rdquo; to be a nice twist, though it felt a bit like what happened in FF III. Actually, just like FF III, you even have to race a chocobo around the world to get an item &hellip;</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/ffv/ffv.037.png"></p>

<p>I teared up (just a bit) when Galuf&rsquo;s flame was extinguished by Exdeath. I was a bit worried that since this game follows FF IV it was possible they would do the whole &ldquo;everyone who died is magically back to fight again for no reason&rdquo; that happened with Yang, Cid, Edward, Tellah &hellip; etc. Fortunately (?), this wasn&rsquo;t the case and it&rsquo;s actually a very emotional point in the story.</p>

<p>I would strongly recommend any fan of JRPGs spend some time on this title. If I were ranking my favourite FFs now, Final Fantasy V would probably show up in the top 5 :)</p>

<p>As for where I&rsquo;m going from here, I&rsquo;m currently about 6-8 hours into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Emerald">Pokémon Emerald</a>. I&rsquo;m sort of enjoying it, though it feels like a watered down version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthBound">Earthbound</a> (just my initial impression).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also about 4-5 hours into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Destiny">Tales of Destiny</a>, but I&rsquo;m not really enjoying this title and likely won&rsquo;t go back to it.</p>

<p>Feel free to leave me some feedback on whether or not I should continue the above, or if you&rsquo;ve got a recommendation for the next title I tackle.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

        <link href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2015/09/23/just-finished-lufia-2/"/>
        <updated>2015-09-23T20:04:59-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2015/09/23/just-finished-lufia-2</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/lufia2/lufia2.000.png"></p>

<p>This review has been a long time coming; a <em>VERY</em> long time coming. I heard about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufia_II:_Rise_of_the_Sinistrals">Lufia 2: Rise of the Sinistrals</a> when I was still in high school, and have been meaning to play it ever since.</p>

<p>Back then, I was just starting to get into JRPGs (though I probably just thought they were RPGs at the time) and was completely infatuated with anything that Square or Enix could crank out (except for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthBound">Earthbound</a>, which is still one of my all-time faves).</p>

<p>In the decade(s) since my teens, I&rsquo;ve picked up Lufia 2 a good dozen times, but have never really given it a fair shake. This time around though, since I&rsquo;m doing this &ldquo;Just Finished&rdquo; series, I thought I&rsquo;d finally sit down and do a full playthrough.</p>

<p>For anyone that has not played this game: PLAY IT! Lufia 2 is now in the top 10 of my favourite 16-bit JRPGs of all time. Hopefully after reading my synopsis here, anyone that was on the fence will also take the plunge (you&rsquo;ll thank me later!).</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Lufia 2 (aka. Estpolis Denki II, aka. エストポリス伝記II) is a hybrid of traditional JRPG and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_role-playing_game">Action RPG</a>. You control one to four characters at a time throughout the adventure, with enemy encounters being handled via fade-away to a turn-based combat system.</p>

<p>It turns out you (Maxim) are destined to fight the Sinistrals, so you embark on a journey to save the world. Cliché? Yup :P</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love a good &ldquo;destined to save the world&rdquo; story, but after playing a handful of JRPGs in succession, I was getting a bit numb to the same story over and over again.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/lufia2/lufia2.026.png"></p>

<p>I decided to give this a fair chance though, and went along with it. I had never played the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufia">Lufia</a> for more than 5-10 minutes, but I do remember the intro segment where you have the four heroes already in the Fortress of Doom getting ready to fight the Sinistrals.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to skip around a bit here because I just want to cover one thing, which is the end of the game &hellip; first. The final battle with Daos for Maxim, Artea, Guy and Selan is the EXACT scene from the first game. This made me REALLY want to go back and play the first game, as I now had a connection with the characters.</p>

<p>Also, I thought I was a really cool transition as it tied the two games together seamlessly.</p>

<h3>Combat</h3>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/lufia2/lufia2.032.png"></p>

<p>Enemy encounters on the overworld are random. As you&rsquo;re walking around, suddenly the screen will zoom in and boom, it&rsquo;s go time! For anyone familiar with JRPGs, this is pretty common.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional RPGs, Lufia 2 doesn&rsquo;t have &ldquo;random&rdquo; encounters in dungeons. All enemies are visible as you explore the dungeons, and though most will chase you, a lot of these battles can be avoided if you so choose.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/lufia2/lufia2.005.png"></p>

<p>Once a battle is initiated, as opposed to a text-based menu of <code>Fight | Magic | Item | Run</code> as you might see in some games, you&rsquo;re presented with an icon cross (reminiscent of <a href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2015/06/10/just-finished-breath-of-fire/">Breath of Fire</a>).</p>

<p>Aside from the standard Attack, Item and Magic options, there is also and Abilities option for each party member. This additional entry gives each character access to various offensive or defensive abilities that are linked to their weapons and armour. This adds another dimension to battles as you have to keep track of what skills are linked to your equipment (don&rsquo;t just hit &lsquo;optimize&rsquo; each time) as weaker items may provide added benefits against certain enemies.</p>

<h3>Puzzles</h3>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/lufia2/lufia2.004.png"></p>

<p>What I really enjoyed about this game from the moment I entered the first dungeon was the puzzles. Littered throughout each dungeon are puzzles that you need to solve in order to open a door and proceed.</p>

<p>Generally, these puzzles aren&rsquo;t all that complex, but they break up the dungeons a bit so it doesn&rsquo;t feel monotonous as you basically do the same things over and over in order to progress the story.</p>

<p>As you move further through the game, you also collect various key items, that can be used in order to help solve the various puzzles (bombs, arrows, hook shot, etc.)</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/lufia2/lufia2.021.png"></p>

<p>These add another dimension to the puzzles that keeps them interesting. I honestly didn&rsquo;t find most puzzles to be very challenging, but I will admit to having to use a walkthrough for at least 2 of them &hellip; (thankfully there are excellent <a href="http://shrines.rpgclassics.com/snes/lufia2/puzzles.shtml">guides on rpgclassics</a> for just these instances where you need a tiny bit of help)</p>

<h3>Party</h3>

<p>Your party is made up of Maxim, and at various points Tia, Guy, Selan, Dekar and Arty.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/lufia2/lufia2.019.png"></p>

<p>Tia is from your home village and follows you on the initial leg of the quest. You think she&rsquo;s going to end up being Maxim&rsquo;s love interest, but that changes once Selan enters the story ;)</p>

<p>Maxim and Selan fall in love, get married, and have a baby. This all happens around the mid-point of the game, acting as a bit of an intermission. Once they have the kid, they decide to go back out and fight so that the world is safe for their baby (and everyone else &hellip; I guess).</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/lufia2/lufia2.028.png"></p>

<p>Guy joins as he&rsquo;s a good fighter and wants to help defeat the Sinistrals. Dekar&rsquo;s reasons are basically the same.</p>

<h3>Capsule Monsters</h3>

<p>Your party can also include capsule monsters. These are optional encounters throughout the game that if you seek out result in an additional character being able to join you in battle.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/lufia2/lufia2.018.png"></p>

<p>Each monster has an elemental affiliation, and can level up with you as you fight enemies. If the capsule monster dies in battle though, they respawn for the next fight, so there&rsquo;s no need to worry about their health (you can&rsquo;t heal them). They do tend to run from a lot of battles automatically though, which can be annoying.</p>

<p>Capsule monsters can also be made stronger by leveling them up through feeding them weapons, armour and items.</p>

<p>This got a bit annoying as I had to hear a lot of &ldquo;Yuk"s from the monsters while trying to find the right items to feed them.</p>

<h3>Music</h3>

<p>I just quickly wanted to touch on the music in this game. For a JRPG not composed by <a href="http://vgmdb.net/artist/77">Nobuo</a>, the soundtrack is pretty solid.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a minute, check out a couple of songs below to get a taste of what&rsquo;s in store for you ;)</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Fzm2O4Zt-k&amp;index=44&amp;list=PL6BB4862ADAA12E48">Final Battle</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E-AD-OUxKg&amp;list=PL6BB4862ADAA12E48&amp;index=10">Peace of Mind</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fk3omXPfuVM&amp;list=PL6BB4862ADAA12E48&amp;index=41">The Lost World</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLIrE5ivseQ&amp;list=PL6BB4862ADAA12E48&amp;index=46">Battle Theme 3</a></li>
</ul>


<p>In case you&rsquo;re wondering, composition credit goes to <a href="http://vgmdb.net/artist/313">Yasunori Shiono</a>.</p>

<h3>Ancient Cave</h3>

<p>This is a completely optional dungeon, but if you&rsquo;re going to play Lufia 2, you HAVE to try and clear it ;)</p>

<p>The ancient cave is 99 randomly generated floors, and you start the cave at level 1 (no matter where you actually are in the game). As you level up and descend further into the cave, you find various treasures and spells that you can only use within the cave.</p>

<p>If you warp out, you lose all experience and items you&rsquo;ve found; aside from items in blue chests (which are few).</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/lufia2/lufia2.038.png"></p>

<p>Once you make it to the last level of the cave, you fight the Master Jelly. This is a brutal fight, as you only have 3 turns in order to beat him, and if you don&rsquo;t, he just runs and that&rsquo;s the end of it (you have to warp out).</p>

<p>Note that I basically cheated to beat him. If you can kill your entire party before he runs, you&rsquo;ll actually win the fight.</p>

<p>I did this, but I didn&rsquo;t find all the Iris Treasures in the cave so it didn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>As great as you probably think I think this game is by now, it is not without its faults.</p>

<p>First off, this game is <em>extremely</em> linear. The plot progresses as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Go to <tower name> tower to find <plot point></li>
<li>Climb tower and fight enemy</li>
<li>Go back to town to learn where next town is</li>
<li>Go to shrine to advance to next town</li>
</ul>


<p>Sure you get a boat at a certain point and it &ldquo;opens&rdquo; up the map, but you still basically go from town to town and tower to tower without much variety.</p>

<p>Also, it may be that I&rsquo;m just a bit more experienced in the genre and know how to level grind, but I found this game to be very, very easy. By the final dungeon, every battle was essentially the same (the final boss included): fight, fight, valor, fight.</p>

<p>All in all though, I really enjoyed this game. Although the story seemed like it was going to be pretty basic at the outset turned out the be really compelling.</p>

<p>There was actually quite a bit of character development. I think this is why at the end when you realize you&rsquo;re basically setting up the intro of Lufia I, you really want to go back and play that game to see if the story continues to be as strong.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll probably give this game another run through in a few years, as it really was enjoyable. I tend to do this with RPGs i enjoy as I forget specifics of the story over the years and enjoy rediscovering them. Final Fantasy IV and VI have had this treatment now probably a good 4-5 times each ;)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write this post for a long time, as I officially got the royalty statement at the end of June, but I&rsquo;ve been a bit busy with life, contracts and the occasional 16-bit era JRPG &hellip;</p>

<p>As of this quarter, <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/redmine-plugin-extension-and-development/book">Redmine Plugin Extension and Development</a> is officially earning me money!</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/royalties-004.png"></p>

<p>Technically, the last statement was <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in_the_black">in the black</a>, however since the terms laid out by Packt Publishing only pays out royalties greater than £75, those earnings were rolled into this quarter.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve updated the table below with the numbers from the current quarter, but I&rsquo;d really like to thank everyone who&rsquo;s bought a copy of this book for supporting the <a href="http://www.redmine.org/">Redmine</a> project, and the vibrant plugin development community as well.</p>

        <link href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2015/07/22/just-finished-final-fantasy-ii/"/>
        <updated>2015-07-22T13:21:52-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2015/07/22/just-finished-final-fantasy-ii</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/ff2/ff2-box.jpg"></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited to finally be able to review this game, as it&rsquo;s the direct sequel to the game that got me into RPGs way back in 1990-91.</p>

<p>When I say Final Fantasy II, I literally mean the second game in the franchise; not the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_IV#North_American_localization">SNES translation of Final Fantasy IV</a> ;)</p>

<p>I actually played a bit of this game in the late 90&rsquo;s using the <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/translations/139/">Demiforce</a> translation patch (back in the good ol' <a href="http://bloodlust.zophar.net/NESticle/nes.html">NESticle</a> days :D), but didn&rsquo;t make it very far.</p>

<p>For the actual play-through, I decided to go with the <a href="http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_I_%26_II:_Dawn_of_Souls">Dawn of Souls</a> version for GBA, as this includes updated graphics, an &ldquo;official&rdquo; translation and an updated soundtrack.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Note that since I&rsquo;m reviewing a remake, I&rsquo;m not sure if some of the gameplay elements below were available in the original. If you happen to have actually completed the original NES version and spot an error, please let me know ;)</p>

<h4>Story</h4>


<p>The story is pretty standard JRPG fare. The Emperor of Palamecia is trying to take over the world. He summons some monsters that destroy the home town of Firion, Maria, Guy and Leon. The first three are rescued by a rebel faction and taken to another town (where they join the rebellion).</p>

<p>Leon goes missing. The party wants to find him. Off they go.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/ff2/ff2.010.png"></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll meet various characters along the way that will join your party and fight with you. (<strong>SPOILERS!</strong> they usually die by sacrificing themselves so you can continue the quest &hellip;)</p>

<p>As you go along, you find out more about the Emperors plan, fight with the Dark Knight who turns out the be Leon, have him join up with you and eventually make your way down to the castle of hell (aka Pandaemonium) to fight the Emperor.</p>

<h4>What's Cool</h4>


<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/ff2/ff2.004.png"></p>

<p>FFII introduces a couple of interesting gameplay elements that were not reused in any future entries in the series.</p>

<p>First, key character conversations allowed you to <em>Learn</em> keywords, which you could then <em>Ask</em> other key characters about. This mechanic helps advance the story as you have to ask various characters about plot points you learn as you go, and they then point you in the direction of your next objective.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/ff2/ff2.009.png"></p>

<p>FFII has multiple modes of travel on the overworld. As with the original, there are ships and an airship, but FFII introduces the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocobo">chocobo</a>.</p>

<p>There is also a bunch of &ldquo;cut-scenes&rdquo; added to this incarnation (which would not have been available in the original NES version). These are nice as they aren&rsquo;t excessive or long, but help advance the plot.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/ff2/ff2.005.png"></p>

<p>Instead of leveling up your characters by fighting and gaining EXP, FFII opted for a system where the more you use a skill, the better you get at it.</p>

<p>For example, the more Firion attacks with a sword, the higher his sword level would go. The more Maria uses the Cure spell, the higher her magic level &hellip; and Cure spell level would go.</p>

<p>This also applied to taking damage. The more damage a player took, the higher their strength and HP levels would go.</p>

<p>I thought this was a very interesting mechanic, and I&rsquo;m not really sure why this didn&rsquo;t make it into any future games.</p>

<h4>What's Not Cool</h4>


<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/ff2/ff2.019.png"></p>

<p>For some reason, this installation in the series decided to introduce an Inn system that charged based on how much healing you required. This proved to be a bit annoying until you realize it&rsquo;s a LOT cheaper to just use cure spells to get everyone&rsquo;s HP back up, THEN rest at the inn ;)</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/ff2/ff2.031.png"></p>

<p>Another annoyance is that throughout the game, in <em>any</em> dungeon you visit, there are doors that lead to empty rooms. LOTS of doors that lead to empty rooms. What&rsquo;s annoying is that these rooms have higher encounter rates, so the first step you take to head back towards the exit generally results in a battle.</p>

<p>The battles aren&rsquo;t necessarily difficult, it&rsquo;s just a pain in the ass to have to wade through all these useless rooms.</p>

<p>On battles in general, once again I&rsquo;m happy to be playing this game using an emulator, as the 8x fast-forward was my best friend.</p>

<p>The encounter rates in this game seem to be pretty high in most areas, and the fights are kind of sluggish. I found that for most non-boss fights, I&rsquo;d just hit fast-forward and hold down the A button (thankfully, you don&rsquo;t have to mash A in this game; just holding it down works :D).</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>


<p>Overall, I really enjoyed the game. The story (I feel) was much better than that of the original, or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_III">FF III</a> (not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VI">FF VI</a>, which is still my favourite installment in the series!)</p>

<p>I really liked the leveling system, and found that since I didn&rsquo;t run from many fights, I didn&rsquo;t have to game the system by just attacking my own party members to boost their HP/defense/stamina stats.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad I jumped back into the Final Fantasy series for a bit; especially with a game I actually haven&rsquo;t beaten before. Whenever I sit down with FF, it&rsquo;s usually either IV, VI or VII.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thinking the next Final Fantasy I tackle will likely be V, as I haven&rsquo;t previously finished this (though I&rsquo;ve gotten close). Not sure when that&rsquo;ll happen, because I&rsquo;m currently balls-deep in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufia_II:_Rise_of_the_Sinistrals">Lufia II</a> ;)</p>

<p>Note that since I&rsquo;ve finished the Dawn of Souls version of FFII, I have access to the <a href="http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Soul_of_Rebirth">Soul of Rebirth</a> additional dungeon.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to actually play this and add to this review, or just publish a minor post to cover what was added therein.</p>

        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2015/06/29/just-finished-breath-of-fire-2</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following on the heels of my playthrough of the original Breath of Fire, I&rsquo;ve just finished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breath_of_Fire_II">Breath of Fire II</a>.</p>

<p>Originally released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1994, BoF2 is the direct sequel to the original. Although the protagonist is named the same (Ryu) as in the original, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s supposed to be the same person (the story takes place hundreds of years after the original).</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/bof2/bof2.000.png"></p>

<p>You start off as a kid in a small town with your buddy Bow. You go visit the outskirts of town where there is a dragon sleeping and blocking a gate. You&rsquo;re attacked by a demon named Barubary, who knocks the two out then disappears.</p>

<p>The story picks up 10 years later with the two trying to make it as rangers and taking odd jobs. You take a job trying to find someone&rsquo;s lost pet, and from there, the game begins.</p>

<p>You save the pet (pig) in an old house where a hermit lives. This house introduces an interesting dynamic to the game as this becomes the location known as TownShip. As you make your may through the game, various people join your town or can be hired to improve it.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/bof2/bof2.002.png"></p>

<p>You can recruit builders, weapon/item shop keepers and magicians that teach you new skills and abilities. Also as your party grows, they can be stashed here in a big house and you can go talk to them at any point to get clues as to what needs to be done next.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The battle system is the same as the original, and most JRPGs of the era; enemies to the left, characters to the right. A menu system controls your actions, which should all be well known by now (Attack, Defend, Magic, Item, Run).</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/bof2/bof2.028.png"></p>

<p>As you progress, you will learn that Ryu is a member of the Dragon Clan (as was the case in the original BoF as well), and can learn to summon various dragons.</p>

<p>In BoF2, you don&rsquo;t need to venture too far off track in order to get the dragons. You actually get the majority of them in groups of three, which is convenient.</p>

<p>You meet a whole cast of characters that can join your party along the way, and each one has a special overworld ability that helps you progress the story.</p>

<p>For example, Sten can reach across some cliffs to grab a pole and drag the party across, Katt can smash rocks to open up pathways, Rand can roll into a ball and get you across vast stretches of the overworld without being attacked.</p>

<p>This last one is convenient as the random enemy encounter rate is pretty high in this game. I&rsquo;m really thankful I was playing this on an emulator that supported fast-forwarding, as the majority of the battles I just auto-fought at 800x speed ;)</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/bof2/bof2.012.png"></p>

<p>There are also multiple ways to get around the world. You can walk, ride on a whale, ride on a giant bird, or fly TownShip around. This last one, I didn&rsquo;t actually get to do as I killed the old guy hooked up to the machine on one of the quests :(.</p>

<p>While playing, depending on the decisions you make, you can affect the type of ending you&rsquo;ll get. Like some other RPGs (ex. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrono_Trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>), there are multiple endings you can get.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t get the best ending, but I didn&rsquo;t get the worst ending either (I chose to go into the gate and fight the end boss).</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/bof2/bof2.038.png"></p>

<p>BoF2 has a lot more &ldquo;cut scenes&rdquo; than the original did. I&rsquo;m not sure if this was the case on the SNES version, but as I was playing the GBA remake, this stood out for me.</p>

<p>The cut-scenes are just still images, but they do provide a nice break from the gameplay and tend to actually contribute to the story at hand (as opposed to just being randomly inserted).</p>

<p>The underlying story of the game is about a religious cult (St. Eva) that is sending souls to the ultimate evil. Once you infiltrate the cult and discover this plot, you can go to the underworld to fight Detheven, but first you have to beat the demon from the beginning of the game: Barubary.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/bof2/bof2.042.png"></p>

<p>You can choose to fight Barubary alone, or as a group. I believe the choice you make here influences the ending you get, but I&rsquo;m not positive &hellip;</p>

<p>I went it alone, and found it to be a very long, difficult fight. You basically have to attack once, heal once, repeat.</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;d knocked off about 3000 points of damage, I finally summoned a dragon to finish him off. This was the recommended strategy as the first few times I fought I used my dragon right away and had my ass kicked shortly thereafter. This <a href="http://shrines.rpgclassics.com/snes/bof2/walkthroughs/bof2walkb.txt">walkthrough</a> really helped ;)</p>

<p>The final battle with Detheven didn&rsquo;t prove to be all that difficult, and once you defeat him and the credits roll, Ryu chooses to take the form of a dragon and sacrifice himself to seal off the doorway to the underworld.</p>

<p>I quite enjoyed this game, though I did find the battle system to be excruciatingly slow. Without fast-forward on, I doubt I would have finished this game. Also, after a battle completes there is a delay before you can move your characters again, which also made the game feel sluggish.</p>

<p>Overall though, I would recommend this to any JRPG fan as the story is solid, the gameplay is fun, and if you like, you can take a break from the action and go fishing for treasure.</p>

<p>As usual, here&rsquo;s the gallery of screenshots. Let me know which one&rsquo;s your favourite in the comments below ;)</p>

<p>For my next playthrough, I&rsquo;m working on <a href="http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_I_%26_II:_Dawn_of_Souls">Final Fantasy II: Dawn of Souls</a>. Shouldn&rsquo;t be too much longer now, as I&rsquo;m already at the Jade Passage, which I believe is the final section of the game.</p>

<p>Did you like Breath of Fire II? Which is your favourite of the series? What should I play next? Is my writing getting any better? Let me know in the comments below if you have any feedback.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just wanted to share a quick story as someone who occasionally publishes stuff (both in <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/redmine-plugin-extension-and-development">print</a> and on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internets">internets</a>).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never really given <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> a fair chance. Every time I would go there, it seemed like the front page just had random links to news stories, or links to pictures.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t really bother to dive in and actually <em>look</em> for content, or bother to checkout the subreddits to see what sorts of communities I might be more inclined to interact with.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I took a couple of my articles from this blog and submitted them (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/39dg8d/just_finished_breath_of_fire/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/39fz7c/accessing_a_running_process_stdout/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/39g909/keeping_pry_breakpoints_out_of_git/">here</a>) to see what sort of feedback/engagement I might see.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/20150612-ga002.png"></p>

<p>Generally, I see anywhere from 5-25 users a day pass through here. That all changed very, VERY quickly once I submitted my content.</p>

<p>Within 12 hours of posting, I&rsquo;d managed to get up to ~ 900 unique users, and by the end of the day, it was over 1000! (<a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/its-over-9000">over 9000</a> would have been sweeter :P)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/20150612-ga001.png"></p>

<p>I had some really great conversations around my content, and got some useful feedback as well.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve posted content to Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and elsewhere, but never really got any good engagement. After this experience though, I know the first place I&rsquo;ll be dropping my new articles, and am even slightly more motivated to get them completed as I know what I can expect from the community :)</p>

<p>Please let me know if there are other communities you&rsquo;ve found that generate good conversations around your content.</p>

        <link href="http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2015/06/10/just-finished-breath-of-fire/"/>
        <updated>2015-06-10T08:34:06-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2015/06/10/just-finished-breath-of-fire</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My original plan for my next playthrough was going to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danganronpa:_Trigger_Happy_Havoc">Daganronpa</a>, but after making it to chapter 5, I got caught up in an phone upgrade bricking (at least <a href="http://mobilesyrup.com/2015/01/22/wind-mobile-users-complaining-of-problems-with-moto-x-lollipop-soak-test/">Wind ended up replacing my phone</a>) fiasco and lost all my progress.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t really feel like starting all over again, so I started <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufia_II:_Rise_of_the_Sinistrals">Lufia II</a> and the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breath_of_Fire_(video_game">Breath of Fire</a>.</p>

<p>I ended up sticking with Breath of Fire, though I want to get through both Lufia and Lufia II eventually ;)</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t really planning on writing about this game, but decided at the last minute, so all my screenshots are from the very end ;)</p>

<p>I played the Game Boy Advance remake on my phone using <a href="http://www.explusalpha.com/home/gba-emu">GBA.emu</a>. Although I&rsquo;m perfectly capable of compiling from source and side-loading the APK, I bought the version on the Play store as the developer deserves the support.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/bof/bof.005.png"></p>

<p>The story starts off the main character, Ryu&rsquo;s hometown. He is one of the last members of the Light Dragon Clan, and the Dark Dragon Clan has just come to eradicate them.</p>

<p>When they set the town ablaze, Ryu&rsquo;s sister Sara turns everyone to stone and ventures out alone to stop the invasion. She is captured, and the game begins with you setting out to fight the Dark Dragons and get her back.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/bof/bof.006.png"></p>

<p>As you make your way through the game, you meet up with additional character that add a new twist to how you solve puzzles. For example, Bo can hunt animals that appear randomly on the overworld map, Karn can open locked doors, Ox can smash certain walls, Gobi can swim under water and Nina eventually morphs into a bird.</p>

<p>I thought this angle was pretty cool, as it makes the game more of an Action-RPG (ala Zelda or Secret of Mana) than a traditional Final Fantasy style JRPG.</p>

<p>Each character has a unique skill that is required to progress the story at some point, so you feel more attached to them than supporting characters from certain other series.</p>

<p>The combat system is a traditional turn-based, menu-driven, pick your attacks and wait for the enemy implementation. If you&rsquo;ve played any other JRPG from this era, you&rsquo;ll feel right at home.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.alexbevi.com/images/bof/bof.000.png"></p>

<p>The main quest progresses in a pretty linear fashion. You&rsquo;re trying to find a bunch of Goddess keys that were used to lock up Tyr long ago, but the Dark dragons are trying to find them as well to let Tyr out to wreak havoc on the world.</p>

<p>You get these keys, fight members of the Dark Dragons, meet characters, unlock more of the map and eventually have to fight Tyr once and for all.</p>

<p>There are side-quests as well that you have to do if you want to learn dragon techniques for Ryu, or fusion techniques for Karn.</p>

<p>If you go to the trouble of getting all the Dragon equipment and finding the final dragon form, Agni, you basically have a Win Stick&trade; for the rest of the game (I highly recommend this :P).</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>This game wasn&rsquo;t overly difficult, and really didn&rsquo;t take that long to complete.</p>

<p>The learning curve wasn&rsquo;t very steep, but this could just be due to having played a lot of other games from the JRPG, Action RPG genres previously.</p>

<p>Since the majority of games that I play nowadays are from <a href="http://www.square-enix.com/">Square Enix</a>, it was nice to run through something from another publisher.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed this game, and am currently working my way through the sequel, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breath_of_Fire_II">Breath of Fire II</a>.</p>

<p>Assuming I don&rsquo;t brick my phone again, hopefully I&rsquo;ll have a review for that next :D.</p>
