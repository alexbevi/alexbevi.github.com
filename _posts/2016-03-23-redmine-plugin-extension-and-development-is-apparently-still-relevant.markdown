For the first five quarters that this book was out in the wild, I was posting publication numbers any time I got a royalty statement from Packt Publishing for [Redmine Plugin Extension and Development](http://www.packtpub.com/redmine-plugin-extension-and-development/book).

I haven't been very active in the [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org/) community in the past year or so as I've been a bit busy with work, contracts and life, but after seeing the last batch of sales figures, it seems people are still interested in this topic.

As was made clear with the above info, there is steady demand for this book, so there must be quite a few plugin authors out there looking to get started with the Redmine platform.

I'm going to try to get my knowledgebase and dropbox plugins updated in the next couple of months, but if there is anything Redmine-related people might be interested, please leave your comments below ;)
