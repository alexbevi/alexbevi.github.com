It's been over a year since this book was published, and I didn't think it would see the type of success it has.

Based on this last statement, I'm officially eligible to start collecting royalties off this book.

This will have to wait until next quarter as Packt only pays out if the total proceeds exceed Â£75; which the USD$78 I earned last quarter doesn't ;)

[Redmine](http://redmine.org) is a very popular open source project management platform, but in order to extend it users need to be familiar with not only the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) language, but the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) framework as well.

This can be quite the barrier to entry for new developers, as they need to have a fair amount of knowledge coming in.

Based on the sales figures I have access to, as well as feedback and inquiries I've received over the last year, it's safe to say that the Redmine community is thriving :)

I've updated the sales chart with my last royalty statement:

| |Ebook Mini|Subscription Packtlib Mini|Print Book Mini|Subscription (3rd Party Mini)|
|-|----------|--------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
|Q1/2014|18|3|18|0|
|Q2/2014|73|1|33|2|
|Q3/2014|25|2|24|4|
|Q4/2014|33|2|31|2|

If you're one of the people that bought the book, please leave a comment and let me know what you thought.

I'm in the process of updating the [knowledgebase plugin](https://github.com/alexbevi/redmine_knowledgebase) that served as the focal point of the book to be compatible with Redmine 3.0 and beyond. If you have any ideas for new features, or feel I should get cracking on the bug fixes, log an issue :)
