This year (January 24, 2023) I had the opportunity to present at [Ruby on Rails Global Summit '23](https://geekle.us/schedule/ruby), which was a [Geekle](https://geekle.us/) sponsored event. As I'm currently a Senior Product Manager and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) focusing on the [Ruby](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/ruby-driver/current/) and [Node.js](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/) Drivers this was a chance to show the audience what a great fit the [Mongoid ODM](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongoid/current/) is for Ruby on Rails developers.

The full talk is available on YouTube, and I've published my notes as well:
* [Ruby on Rails Global Summit '23 â€“ Junior Track](https://www.youtube.com/live/UCdVBOJI3Ow?feature=share&t=17876)
* [Ruby on Rails Global Summit '23: Ruby on Rails and MongoDB - Note](https://gist.github.com/alexbevi/e25f0214c1d131db27043e38fc5069d3)

If you're unsure what an ODM (Object-Document Mapper) is, I have another article that provides more information regarding [MongoDB ORMs, ODMs, and Libraries]({% post_url 2022-11-02-mongodb-orms-odms-and-libraries %}).
