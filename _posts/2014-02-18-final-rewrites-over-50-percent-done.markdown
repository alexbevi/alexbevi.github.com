This is just a quick post to update everyone that chapters 1, 2 and 3 of [Redmine Plugin Extension and Development](http://www.packtpub.com/redmine-plugin-extension-and-development/book) have been submitted to Packt with final revisions. Chapter 8 as well as the Appendix were accepted after the initial round of rewrites, so that means *4 MORE CHAPTERS TO GO!!!*

Clearly I didn't meet the target I hinted at in my last post, but it was [Family Day](http://www.statutoryholidays.com/family-day.php) here so I took the family away for the long weekend to go skating on the [Rideau Canal](http://www.ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places-to-visit/rideau-canal-skateway) in Ottawa :)
