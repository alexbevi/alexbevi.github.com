I finally got around to adding an [Anime](/anime) section to this blog where I can track my Plex library.

Since this is the first post, I figure I'll just list of what I've worked my way through in the past six months or so and what's currently on deck.

### Finished

These are the series that I've recently completed.

* Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
* Darker than Black (Season 1)
* Sword Art Online (Season 1)
* Attack on Titan
* Deadman Wonderland

### On Deck

What I'm either currently watching, or planning on hitting up soon.

* Serial Experiments Lain
* Legend of Korra (I liked Avatar, so figured ... why not :P)
* Death Note
* Big O

### Future

Based on what I'm currently interested in, I'll probably dip my toes in periodically to see if I should pay closer attention to these series soon.

* Elfen Lied
* Ergo Proxy
* Technolyze
* Log Horizon
* Accel World
