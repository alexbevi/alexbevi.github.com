I signed up for [Google AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense) in January of 2015 in hopes of subsidizing some of the time I spent writing with ad-based revenue. Without doing any research I quickly formed some baseless expectations of success and profitability that would see my sparsely populated, personal blog be a vehicle to financial freedom!

Well humble reader ... I DID IT! Ok, not really - AdSense has a [payment threshold](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1709871?hl=en) of $100, so until you earn at least that much nothing will ever be paid out. Fast forward 7 years and I finally drove enough traffic to be able to cash out for the first time.

At this rate I'm only earing about $1.19 a month so I guess I won't be quitting my day job ... but hey, money's money ;)
