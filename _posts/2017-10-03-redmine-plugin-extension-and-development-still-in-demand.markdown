It's been a [while]({% post_url 2016-03-23-redmine-plugin-extension-and-development-is-apparently-still-relevant %}) since I last wrote about [Redmine Plugin Extension and Development](http://www.packtpub.com/redmine-plugin-extension-and-development/book) so I thought I'd give a quick update.

I have been sharing sales numbers whenever possible as a way of (hopefully) encouraging other authors to see that there is some money out there, even for obscure niche topics.

This isn't a super lucrative endeavour, but considering I published this book three years ago and it's still in demand, I can't complain.

If I had more time on my hands I might look into writing about something a bit more "in demand", like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) (random topics I'm currently interested in :P).
