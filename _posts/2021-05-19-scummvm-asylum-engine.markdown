I started on a reverse engineering journey to port reimplement Dreamforge's [Sanitarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitarium_(video_game)) to [ScummVM](https://www.scummvm.org/) in July of 2009.Â Though I loved playing this game when it first came out, what really rekindled my interest was the [Gamasutra Postmortem article](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3299/postmortem_dreamforges_sanitarium.php).

The postmortem included some interesting technical details about the development of the title that helped inform some of the early static analysis work done using [IDA Pro](https://www.hex-rays.com/ida-pro/) to disassemble the game's executable (`sntrm.exe`).

With some early progress




Reached out to [Mike Breitkreutz](https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,3583/) in 2009 via MySpace trying to get some additional information about the project to help with our reverse engineering efforts.
