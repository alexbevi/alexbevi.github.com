Although I haven't used my [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net) account in a number of years, when I started working with [ScummVM](http://www.scummvm.org), that's where the code and issue tracker were, so that's where the development community was as well.

They've since moved to [GitHub](https://github.com/scummvm), but SourceForge has included them in the running for Project of the Month, January 2015.

If you've still got an account, or just feel like creating one to show them some love, head on over to the [voting page for POTM](https://sourceforge.net/p/potm/discussion/vote/thread/7a6c5c42/) and reply with `VOTE: scummvm`.

They've got my vote ;)
