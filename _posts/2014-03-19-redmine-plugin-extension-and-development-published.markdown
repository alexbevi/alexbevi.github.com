Well, it's official. The journey I began over six months ago has finally come to an end, and [Redmine Plugin Extension and Development](http://www.packtpub.com/redmine-plugin-extension-and-development/book) has officially been published :)

I plan on doing a "post-mortem" on the process at some point, but for now I'm planning on taking a little time off from writing.
