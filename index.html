    <p><img class="left" src="/images/wca/wca.08.png"></p>

<p>Although I&rsquo;m a huge fan of the point-and-click adventure genre, I&rsquo;ve been primarily focusing on covering 16-bit RPGs in my spare time. I&rsquo;ve still got a sizeable backlog to wade through, but when the news dropped that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_Adventures:_Lord_of_the_Clans">Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans</a> had been leaked, I couldn&rsquo;t resist.</p>

<p>Although no one really got a taste of this game until 2010 when MAN-biker posted some content to Youtube, I&rsquo;d been inquiring with Blizzard as early as 2008. I still have a copy of the email, so I&rsquo;ve trimmed it down a bit and shared it below.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/alexbevi/790743a5b30963103596fa77f04fe75a.js"> </script>


<p>My hope was to get access to the source code for the <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/">ScummVM</a> team to be able to incorporate as a custom engine.</p>

<p>Unfortunately (though not unsurprisingly), Blizzard wouldn&rsquo;t release the code.</p>

<p>Now, once word got out that the complete game had been released (not legally I know &hellip;), I had to grab it and give it a shot.</p>

<p>Being a game from the late 90&rsquo;s, I didn&rsquo;t expect it to just work. My primary machines run Linux, so I first tried to run this through <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">wine</a>, which didn&rsquo;t end up working reliably.</p>

<p>I then built a Windows XP VM using VirtualBox. This managed to run
the game with no issues.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p>When I first started playing WCA, it was a nice trip down memory lane. The gameplay mechanics really seemed to borrow heavily from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Throttle_(1995_video_game)">Full Throttle</a>, which was one of my favourite point-and-click adventures in the &lsquo;90s.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/wca/wca.05.png"></p>

<p>Right-clicking brings up a graphical command menu that lets you talk, look or use.</p>

<p>You can interact with the environment based on designated hotspots (which are identified when hovered by showing a label).</p>

<p>Thrall will usually try to respond with a funny comment whenever possible, which makes it more compelling to click around and see what he has to say about his surroundings.</p>

<h1>Puzzles</h1>

<p>As with most adventure games of this era, the puzzles are predominantly fetch-quests and inventory manipulation quests. Again, if you grew up with these games this type of mechanic is old hat, but if you&rsquo;re new to the genre, this can seem a bit tedious.</p>

<p>I found that the puzzles were a bit on the easy side (until the last 10 minutes of the game). This could just be because I&rsquo;m used to these sorts of games, but until I need to dig around in the dragon&rsquo;s stomach for the pig&rsquo;s jetpack, everything was straightforward and I didn&rsquo;t feel the need to look to Google for the answer.</p>

<h2>Story</h2>

<p>As per the <a href="http://wow.gamepedia.com/Warcraft_Adventures:_Lord_of_the_Clans">Gamepedia</a> article:</p>

<p>Basically, after the Dark Portal was destroyed and the rift between the worlds was destroyed, you had a large group of orcs that were trapped on Azeroth. And over the course of the next few years, the humans, being merciful in their ways, instead of hunting down and eradicating these orcs, granted them land areas where they could live as long as they lived within the confines of societal expectations. Basically, they were put on these reservations or camps. And because they were made to live in a way that was very contrary to their basic nature, a lot of the spirit and fire that defines them as a culture was drained out of them. And so what you found yourself with was an orc society in Azeroth of forced passivity, not forced through violence but forced through situation.
Although down on their luck, the orcs in Warcraft Adventures were supposed to experience a rebirth, thanks to the leadership of Thrall.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/wca/wca.10.png"></p>

<p>Our storyline followed an orc baby that was taken from a battle scene where his parents were slain and raised by a human lieutenant, Blackmoore, with the intention of raising him with human ideals but being able to use him to control the orcs. Definitely someone who does not fit into the general stereotype of noble humans. He was a self-serving, dark human character who wanted to raise this orc, Thrall, our central character in the game, and use him to control and command the orcs and then raise them as his own private army. Thrall, though he&rsquo;s raised in captivity by humans to serve their will, still has some fire within him that he can&rsquo;t deny, so he rebels against his human owners. He escapes the compound where he&rsquo;s being held, and then over the course of the game, what we do is follow his adventures. As he discovers more about himself and the orcs and what it means to be an orc, so does the player. As you go through the game, you meet some familiar faces from the games, some in retirement, some trying to lead an underground resistance, and you learn of what happened to the Frost Wolf Clan, which was the clan that Thrall&rsquo;s father Durotan was a part of. You learn that Durotan, Blackhand and Doomhammer were three blood brothers, and that his clan Frost Wolf was sent into the Dwarf Highlands in the mountains. They were exiled there by a plotting Ner'zhul, when he was pulling the strings in the background behind Doom Hammer and Black Hand, because he knew that Durotan was a threat.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>As a throwback to &lsquo;90s point-and-click adventures, I&rsquo;d say WCA is worth playing. If you enjoyed the genre, this is a no brainer, and if you&rsquo;ve never played this type of game, this is a pretty easy entry.</p>

<p>The version of the game that was leaked is pretty close to being completed. I didn&rsquo;t notice any issues or major omissions.</p>

<p>The quality of the FMVs are pretty low compared to other games from the late &lsquo;90s. The pacing of the game isn&rsquo;t too slow and the story is interesting enough to make you want to see it through to the end.</p>

<p>Playing Warcraft Adventures actually made me want to revisit some other adventure games. I get the urge to play through Day of the Tentacle every 4-5 years or so, and I think it&rsquo;s been almost that long &hellip;</p>

        <p>I don&rsquo;t really have much progress to report for the last month, so I thought I&rsquo;d throw out a few of the games I&rsquo;ve been working through to see if I can generate any interest in the next article ;)</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/goldensun/goldensun.016.png"></p>

<p>First off, I&rsquo;ve been playing through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Sun">Golden Sun</a> for the GBA.</p>

<p>I really like the psyenergy system and how you use it for puzzle solving. It makes this game a bit more of an ARPG along the same lines as <a href="/blog/2015/09/23/just-finished-lufia-2/">Lufia 2</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made it as far as <a href="http://goldensun.wikia.com/wiki/Kraken">Kraken</a>, but I&rsquo;m finding beating him is proving to be more difficult that I&rsquo;d expected. Probably going to have to back out and grind for a while, which I don&rsquo;t have a lot of time for &hellip;</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/7th-saga/7th-saga.019.png"></p>

<p>Next, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ve given up on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7th_Saga">the 7th Saga</a>. I&rsquo;m still at Telaine with a party at level 17, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that to progress, there is grinding in my future.</p>

<p>Similar to the situation I&rsquo;m having above with Golden Sun, i just need to set many hours aside to level up in order to proceed, but with the amount of time I&rsquo;ve got these days to devote to these games, that may never happen.</p>

    <div class="article__content clearfix">
        <p>I actually finished this game around the end of June, but haven&rsquo;t really had a chance to write about it until now. I&rsquo;m currently sitting out by the lake at the cottage and figured it was about time :P</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/dq1/dq1.000.png"></p>

<p>The last time I played through Dragon Quest was likely in the late 80&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I either heard about it, or got a copy of it through Nintendo Power, and like most kids in North America at the time, this would have been my first introduction to what would become known as JRPGs.</p>

<p>I decided to go with the SNES re-release of this title for my playthrough as I wanted some updated graphics and music. Although the SNES version was never officially localized for North America, there is an <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/translations/337/">excellent fan translation</a> available.</p>

<p>It threw me off a bit when they refer to the legendary hero as Roto (as opposed to Erdrick), but I&rsquo;m assuming this is a better translation than what we got in the 80&rsquo;s so that&rsquo;s probably what the name should have been in the first place.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/dq1/dq1.001.png"></p>

<p>Dragon Quest was essentially the first JRPG. As a result, there are a lot of concepts introduced here that would be adapted and refined by other titles and series over the years. This means that some parts of this game feel a bit rough or unbalanced.</p>

<p>I originally played the NES version of this title, and have fond memories of just how brutally hard it was. This game introduced me to what I would come to know as &ldquo;grinding&rdquo;, as you couldn&rsquo;t progress through the game unless your character was sufficiently leveled up in order to tackle the monsters in the areas you were exploring.</p>

<p>This meant walking back and forth and fighting random monsters.</p>

<p>Enemy encounter rates are high. Very high. I think the SNES version actually optimized this a bit, but the rates are still high. This is useful for grinding, but gets tedious when you want to explore, or really need to get back to a town to heal.</p>

<p>The story is pretty simple.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re the descendant of the legendary hero, and have been tasked with rescuing the princess and defeating the Dragon Lord.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: 2016-09-05</strong> - It was pointed out on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/4uxq5n/just_gave_up_on_shadowrun_genesis">the Reddit thread</a> and in the comments below that I might have used a cheat which prevented finishing the game. I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d used one, but I think while doing research for the article i may have been testing it out :(</p>

<p>Note that you don&rsquo;t really need to cheat in this game to get more Nuyen; just grind ;)</p>

<p>Thanks to those who responded. It&rsquo;s worth noting that if you&rsquo;re going to play this game, <em>avoid the cheat menu</em> as it will bite you in the ass.</p>

<hr />

<p>As I work my way through the 8-bit and 16-bit games I grew up with, there are (and will continue to be) those that I just can&rsquo;t get through. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_(1994_video_game)">Shadowrun</a> for the Sega Genesis turned out to be one of those titles.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made it all the way to the final boss, and though he doesn&rsquo;t beat me, I empty all my clips (and my runner&rsquo;s clips) into him and just can&rsquo;t seem to kill him and trigger the endgame sequence.</p>

<p>This is extremely frustrating as I&rsquo;ve effectively finished this game, but if I can&rsquo;t beat the last boss I can&rsquo;t in good conscience call this a &ldquo;Just Finished&rdquo; article.</p>

<p>Regardless, I&rsquo;ve gone through enough of this game to be able to write about it, and based on my experience, recommend it to other players looking for some good retro cyberpunk action-RPG gaming.</p>

    <p>As a kid of the 80&rsquo;s, I have fond memories of all the old 8-bit and 16-bit consoles that I grew up with.</p>

<p>Although it&rsquo;s easy enough to find ROMs, I tend to find myself going for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoodTools">GoodTools</a> generated sets more often than not as they&rsquo;re considered &ldquo;complete&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This is kind of ridiculous as I don&rsquo;t speak Japanese, which constitutes the vast majority of the contents of these sets.</p>

<p>Even though most emulators support compressed ROM sets, I&rsquo;d prefer to just have the English ROMs available on their own in one place.</p>

<p>As a programmer, I thought &ldquo;How can I do this in Linux?&rdquo;, but more specifically, &ldquo;how do I do this from the command line directly?&rdquo;.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'># extract best rom to directory
</span><span class='line'># best contains !
</span><span class='line'>7z e "*.7z" -o../../ *[!]*.* -r
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'># purge all non US/European
</span><span class='line'>find . -type f ! -name '*(U)*' ! -name '*(E)*' -delete
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'># purge duplicates where a (U) exists alongiside an (E)
</span><span class='line'>for f in *"(E)"*; do us=`echo $f | sed -r 's/\(E\)+/\(U\)/g'`; if [ -e "$us" ]; then echo "FOUND $us - removing $f"; rm "$f"; fi; done</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you find yourself with compressed ROM sets and you want to just grab the English ones, this might just come in handy ;)</p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I posted the <a href="/blog/2016/04/19/just-finished-seiken-densetsu-3/">Seiken Densetsu 3</a> review, so I figured as it might be a while before I get around to posting more content, I&rsquo;ll just throw up a quick update.</p>

<h2>Gaming</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/shadowrun-gens/shadowrun.015.png"></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently working my way through three games. After finishing the <a href="/blog/2016/02/23/just-finished-shadowrun/">Shadowrun</a> play-through for SNES, I got some good feedback about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_(1994_video_game)">Genesis version</a>. I decided to give that a go, and I&rsquo;ve currently made it to the last boss, but am having no luck beating him.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m going to have to save up some nuyen and grind it out with some better runners in order to be able to beat Thon. This is a bit of a pain in the ass, and is the reason I ended up abandoning <a href="/blog/2015/01/16/just-finished-terranigma/">Terranigma</a> previously.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed that game, but since I&rsquo;ve got very limited time decided to move on to the next challenge.</p>

<p>By challenge, I meant <em>CHALLENGE</em>. I decided to give <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7th_Saga">The 7th Saga</a> another shot, and have now officially made it MUCH further than I ever have before.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiken_Densetsu_3">Seiken Densetsu 3 (聖剣伝説3)</a> is the third installment in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mana_(series)">Mana series</a>. It&rsquo;s the sequel to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_of_Mana">Secret of Mana</a>, which is the entry into the series that most North American gamers would be familiar with.</p>

<p>Once again, I played through this game on my phone using the fantastic <a href="http://www.explusalpha.com/home/snes9x-ex">Snes9x EX</a>. Please support this dev as he provides a fantastic product. For some reason though, most of the screenshots I took came out stretched. This hasn&rsquo;t happened before, and I&rsquo;ve been playing a couple other games that this isn&rsquo;t happening for either, so I&rsquo;ll chalk this up to bad luck :|</p>

<p><img src="/images/sd3/sd3.005.png"></p>

<p><em>NOTE</em> I ran these screenshots through <a href="http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/">pngcrush</a> (<code>ls *.png | while read line; do pngcrush -ow -brute $line; done</code>) to get the size down a bit ;)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m leaving these images in here as they were part of my &ldquo;journey&rdquo;, though hopefully they don&rsquo;t deter anyone from playing this game, as the game is <em>fantastic</em>.</p>

<p>First off, if you&rsquo;re a fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_of_Mana">Secret of Mana</a>, the initial &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of the game will be familiar, as will the art style and sound.</p>

    <p>For the first five quarters that this book was out in the wild, I was posting publication numbers any time I got a royalty statement from Packt Publishing for <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/redmine-plugin-extension-and-development/book">Redmine Plugin Extension and Development</a>.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been very active in the <a href="http://www.redmine.org/">Redmine</a> community in the past year or so as I&rsquo;ve been a bit busy with work, contracts and life, but after seeing the last batch of sales figures, it seems people are still interested in this topic.</p>

<p>As was made clear with the above info, there is steady demand for this book, so there must be quite a few plugin authors out there looking to get started with the Redmine platform.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to try to get my knowledgebase and dropbox plugins updated in the next couple of months, but if there is anything Redmine-related people might be interested, please leave your comments below ;)</p>

    <div class="article__content clearfix">
        <p>I had this game finished around Christmas, but I find my motivation for writing these articles is starting to languish. I&rsquo;m hoping to get that spark back with the next couple of titles i&rsquo;ll be tackling, even though Shadownrun was one of my favourite SNES games of all time.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/shadowrun/shadowrun.001.png"></p>

<p>You wake up on a slab in the morgue. You don&rsquo;t know who you are or how you got there. That&rsquo;s pretty much all you&rsquo;ve got to go on when you start this game for the first time.</p>

<p>The intro shows you being gunned down, then a shapeshifter casts a spell on you and takes off. After getting out of the morgue, you run into &ldquo;Dog&rdquo;, who appears to be a shamanistic totem.</p>

<p>This was the first 10 minutes of this game, and I remember playing this back in &lsquo;94 and being hooked at this point.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_(1993_video_game)">Shadowrun</a> is a cyberpunk action-RPG for the Super Nintendo. You control Jake Armitage, a courier who has something important uploaded to his head computer.</p>
