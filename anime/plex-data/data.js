After kissing him as part of her remuneration, she prepares to kill him, but Kobayashi steps in and reveals that it wasn\u2019t Hei who killed Youko. The real culprit was Shizume Genma who had betrayed them for the CIA, and the Americans have taken over control of most of the organizations inside and outside Japan. Given all this, Mina has Kobayashi and Hei go on ahead while she goes to take care of Genma, and Kobayashi takes Hei to where Yin\u2019s body is. The body, however, is now only an empty shell, and Yin\u2019s awakened spirit has gone to the center of the Gate. By now, Madame Oreille has brought Misaki and Mao to a building that houses a super-computer created by Dr. Pavlichenko. In it are rows of bodies that look like Shion, and Madame Oreille explains that the super-computer has all records of the world as observed by the Doll Network and all memories of mankind gathered by the ME Network. It was all for Shion\u2019s plan, and Madame Oreille reveals that the moon isn\u2019t really a moon - it\u2019s another Earth created by Shion\u2019s ability. At this moment, unaware of all this, Suou is pushing Shion in his wheelchair somewhere inside the Gate. In talking about Suou\u2019s memories, Shion reveals that he only imagined human-like memories and put them in her and that his dream isn\u2019t a reflection of those memories. He also notes Suou\u2019s sentimentality despite being a Contractor, and Suou attributes it to the influence of the people she traveled with. The two then come across the dead body of a Contractor, and Shion disappears in that instant. Suou searches inside the Gate for Shion until she comes across one of July\u2019s observer spirits. While she\u2019s following it to him, July is being found by August 7 who tells him that their operation is over. July, however, refuses to go with August 7 and chooses instead to stay with Suou, so August 7 lets him go and disappears. Suou arrives just moments later, and after hugging her, July leads her to Shion and Yin. Suou finds Shion almost dead, and in his final words, he tells her that the deal is done and that he wants her to see the world he created. His spirit then goes to Yin, who is floating above them, and Yin tells Suou that she granted Shion\u2019s wish. At this point, July collapses as well, and, still not really understanding what\u2019s going on, Suou decides to bring out her gun against Yin. This leads to Yin breaking the meteor core on the necklace that Shion is wearing. As Madame Oreille explains to Misaki and Mao, when they copy a person and implant memories, they can\u2019t establish it for long without the meteor core. They thus used Suou and her journey here as an experiment to make sure that Suou\u2019s memories had set. What this means for Suou now that the meteor core is destroyed is that her memories are leaving her. Realizing what\u2019s happening, Suou tries to resist the loss of memories and aims her gun at Yin again in a last ditch effort, however Hei shows up and stops her from shooting. As he holds her, he tells her that she won\u2019t be needing her gun where she\u2019s going next, and he promises that he\u2019ll always be with her. He lays her down beside July after she loses consciousness, and Yin then tells Hei that it\u2019s not too late to kill her. By the time Misaki arrives on the scene, she sees BK-201\u2019s star lighting up in the sky, and a bright light envelops Yin as she\u2019s touched by Hei.\nIn the aftermath, Suou lives a normal life with both her parents on the copied Earth. She can sense that something is lacking, and though she\u2019s not lonely, she feels that she knows a certain someone very well and believes that she\u2019ll meet this person someday. Back on the real Earth, Kobayashi thinks that it\u2019s all over, but Misaki feels that things are just beginning, and Madame Oreille picks them both up. They then leave the Gate and start operating independently since America and other countries now control Tokyo, and ironically, they become known as the Syndicate. What they don\u2019t know is what the prophesied newly born thing is and how it will change the world. Unbeknownst to them, a boy resembling Yin wakes up inside the Gate and absorbs the spirits of John Smith and his men. Regardless, Misaki notes that she hasn't heard of Hei again, but she continues to believe that he\u2019s still alive.

Back down the long passageway, Maka uses her new-found power and fighting style to go toe-to-toe with Chrona, but the madness is literally overwhelming Soul. Inside of herself, the calm Maka uses this chance to match her soul wavelength with Chrona\u2019s, and this brings her to a desert world where she finds a young Chrona. At around this same time, out in Death City, Blair is having no problems handling the members of the Mizune family. The witches, however, combine and transform into a single larger woman, so Blair transforms into her human appearance as well.

Medusa replies that Chrona is useless and a failure since Chrona was raised without any independence, and her plan to throw Chrona away infuriates Maka\u2019s father. \n\nAt this moment, Maka is watching over a young Chrona who is in the desert world wondering what to do. Chrona draws a circle in the sand around herself to mark her own area, but she does nothing more than just sit down inside this circle until her shadow appears. The shadow starts asking Chrona about herself and tries to delve into how Chrona feels, but Chrona passes on answering any of the questions. The shadow eventually suggests that Chrona doesn\u2019t know how to interact with others and can only repeat self-denials, and it decides that they\u2019re at their limit, so it disappears. This leaves Chrona alone to think about how Maka had introduced herself before their battle, and that particular time, Chrona was able to answer with her own name. To Chrona\u2019s surprise, young Maka suddenly appears. Chrona tries to prevent Maka from entering the circle in the sand and reveals that she feels secure when she\u2019s in it since she can\u2019t interact others, but Maka walks inside anyway and proceeds to erase the circle. This leads to Chrona to start screaming back in the real world, and her body goes crazy due to a rejection reaction. \n\nWith Soul\u2019s help, Maka is able to regain control of her body in the real world, and she then approaches Chrona without her weapon. Despite all the spikes shooting out of Chrona, Maka calms Chrona and hugs her. She now understands Chrona\u2019s wavelength, and she feels that it\u2019s not that Chrona doesn\u2019t know how to interact with others - it\u2019s that there was no one was close to her.

Medusa eventually stabs Stein in the gut, and from that, he counterattacks with his signature Kon-i attack. Though greatly injured, Medusa thinks she has won because she\u2019s in position to cut off Stein\u2019s head with her Tail Snake. She is thus surprised when she suddenly freezes in place, unable to move at all. The reason is because Stein had used one of his suture techniques on her entire body.

He attempts to use his Big Wave attack, but Ashura isn\u2019t fazed at all and knocks him out with a single flick of the hand. He knocks out Kid in a similar fashion by stretching out his skin like a rubber band and hitting Kid\u2019s head with it.

Marie believes them since she\u2019s also lost, and it takes two hours for her to help Crona find her way back to her room. Nevertheless, Marie tells Crona to come to her if she\u2019s ever bothered by anything again. Once back in her room, Crona is paid a visit by Eruka in her frog form who\u2019s able to communicate with Medusa via the snakes in her body. Since Crona doesn\u2019t think that she can find the vault, Medusa decides instead to take advantage of Marie\u2019s kindness towards Crona and gives Crona a pen with a listening device inside to plant in Stein\u2019s laboratory. \n\nCrona thus goes to Marie under the pretense that she wants to talk, and Marie brings her to Stein\u2019s laboratory. While Ragnarok has Marie distracted, Crona puts the snake listening device inside Marie\u2019s coffee, and she then watches as Marie drinks it. Afterward, when Crona goes to leave, Marie stops her because she almost left the pen behind. Eruka explains later that the snake will allow Medusa both to eavesdrop and to accelerate the madness in Stein. After hearing over the radio how fondly Marie talks about her to Stein, Crona quietly returns to her room and retreats to a dark corner with a pillow. As the darkness around her spreads, Crona starts crying.","rating":6,"duration":1417217,"view_count":0},"4363":{"key":4363,"title":"Legend of the Holy Sword 3: The Academy Gang Leader`s Tale?","index":32,"summary":"A Shibusen student named Hiro who is often taken advantage of by other students has discovered Excalibur\u2019s book and envisions himself as a hero, so he goes and retrieves the legendary sword.

Shinigami-sama has summoned him today to talk about how Arachnophobia has discovered the location of one of Eibon\u2019s tools called BREW. Shinigami-sama foresees a big battle and urges Stein to get the students trained up to handle it. Stein thus takes the class out to practice, but before the lesson begins, Black*Star does some private training where he attempts to understand the other existence inside of Tsubaki. This leads him to an encounter with a giant beast who asks him about seeking power, and Black*Star answers that it\u2019s so that he can surpass God. The beast, however, sees Black*Star more as an ogre. After waking back up from this vision, Black*Star joins Maka and Kid to practice their team soul resonance. Explaining the situation to them, a very serious Stein warns them that if they don\u2019t pass, then they\u2019ll be removed from his class. Maka feels the need to tell Black*Star in particular to do this properly, but he insists that he always does. Despite this, the trio fails multiple times, and Maka gets frustrated because it\u2019s Black*Star each time that she and Kid can\u2019t seem to link up with. She starts arguing with him, but Kid steps in between them, and Stein decides to give them a break to cool down. \n\nStein himself is going through another episode of madness when Maka comes to talk with him and brings him out of it. Maka wants him to remove Black*Star from the team, but Stein points out that she\u2019s the one who\u2019s quitting the team. When she tries to make the case against Black*Star, Stein questions if she wants to limit Black*Star\u2019s power and makes the point that Black*Star is their team\u2019s best attacker. He thinks that she has misunderstood the soul resonance link and urges her to feel the essence of it more. However, when Maka returns to the others, Black*Star accuses her of tattling to Stein and being selfish. This infuriates Maka, and she tries to punch him, but he just flips her on her back. She gets back up and tries to punch him again, and this time, he lets her hit him and questions afterward if she\u2019s satisfied. He warns her that any further and it\u2019d be a duel, and he\u2019s ready to crush her. Unable to face him, Maka curses at the top of her lungs and runs off in tears. Tsubaki goes after her and finds her staring into the distance at the edge of the forest. Since Maka is still pissed off at Black*Star, Tsubaki relates how Black*Star studies before tests, yet still gets zeros. Opening up a bit, Maka feels that she can never match her soul wavelength to Black*Star\u2019s, but Tsubaki points out that Maka and Black*Star have always gotten along and that friends can have times where they don\u2019t understand each other. \n\nRemembering what Stein told her, Maka realizes what she had been missing and returns to the team. Along the way, she admits to Tsubaki that she had sometimes been jealous of Black*Star and has wanted to become strong like he is. She apologizes to him when she gets back, and he appears not to hold a grudge as the group resumes their training. The next time they try the team soul resonance, they succeed. Maka now knows that there\u2019s no need to forcibly understand each other - they just need to recognize each other\u2019s senses and believe in each other. Observing from nearby, Stein gives the group a passing grade and notes that their leader is Maka.

A small army of Shibusen students and staff are already headed towards the island, and the plan is to have Sid\u2019s force take care of the Arachnophobia forces while Marie, Stein, and the students head for the magnetic field. Once there, Marie and Stein will head into the field while the students stand by outside until the two return.

With this turn of events, Ox, Kilik, and Kim decide to stay behind to fight while Maka, Kid, and Black*Star enter the magnetic field. Once the latter three emerge on the other side, they find themselves no longer surrounded by snow. They are instead now in a jungle-like environment with a step pyramid towering in front of them. What\u2019s even stranger is that they see Shinigami-sama flying towards the step pyramid, and he\u2019s wearing his old mask from before Shibusen was founded. Because of this, the three of them head towards the pyramid, unaware that they\u2019re being followed by a pack of mice.

Maka\u2019s attention is then turned to one of the witches nearby: Arachne. Her men have Eibon\u2019s blueprints, and Arachne comments on how they lured Shinigami-sama here and how they\u2019re going to blow up the facility.
